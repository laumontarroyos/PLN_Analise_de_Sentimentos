1,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Tons of editing errors in lectures, and the programming problems rely more on knowledge of Keras (essentially untaught throughout the course) than they do on understanding of lecture material. A disgraceful end to an otherwise solid course sequence."
2,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"This course is by far the weakest out of the 5 course sequence. I did well in it (96.8%) but I think the programming exercises did not help build understanding of sequence models. Often I found myself just trying to get through the programming because I felt it was more an exercise in reading Keras documentation. I think you can pass this course without a solid understanding of what is going on in the sequence models. The programming exercises should be revamped to focus more on understanding what is happening in the program rather than trying to figure out Keras syntax (which is also useful, but perhaps better suited for a prep course)."
3,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Full of appalling errors that have been present for over 1 year.  No one fixes it.  It is clear that since Ng was let go by Stanford and Baidu, he is trying to earn a living with deep learning_ai.  This apparently is not working as the small income from Coursera is not sufficient. As a result the prerecorded classes remain on Coursera to accrue some residual income.  But, Andrew Ng and the staff are apparently gone."
4,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"I really like the deeplearning.ai specialization. And also I like the Sequence Models course. However, I feel that I have learned less during this course comparing to the other ones in the specialization. First, I believe it was an extensive use of Keras. Whereas the framework is great, it would be much better for understanding if all the exercises were in numpy, whereas Keras tween-projects be optional.  Doing both numpy and Keras versions would allow to better understand the material and learn through repetition. Second, even though the course is great, I perceived the number of errors/typos was much higher than in other courses. Is that true? For example, the Jazz Improvisation exercise was a nightmare. Overall, thank you for the course. Despite those problems, I would still recommend it."
5,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"The lectures were great. Andrew is a wonderful teacher, but the assignments were beyond miserable. Jupyter notebook is probably the least stable, most infuriating piece of software that I've been forced to interact with. I spent countless hours trapped, not able to perform the most basic of operations, such as saving my work or submitting. I lost work innumerable times. I, like others, eventually resorted to ""saving"" my work by copying it into a text editor on my system for fear of Jupyter sabotaging me. Even if the system was stable, most of the assignments were worthless as learning experiences. The majority of ""programming"" boiled down to playing a cryptic game of fill in the blank. Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone in its current state. Especially as a paid service. I really expected better quality."
6,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Keras is required to pass the assignments but no training provided for it. I can learn it myself of course but then the question is this - what am I paying for?
7,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"To set the context, I have a PhD in Computer Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. I am a working professional (13+ years), but just getting into the field of ML and AI. Apologies for flashing this preamble for every course that I review on coursera."
8,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I am so grateful that Andrew and the team provided such good course, I learn so much from this course, I am so excited that see the wake word detection model actually work in the programming exercise"
9,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I want to thank Andrew Ng and his team for the amazing work. You definitely make the world a better place sharing this knowledge, and it is an inspiration."
10,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"I went through all course of DeepLearning.ai Specialization. While I was more, or less happy with first 4 courses in this specialization, I have a very bad impression regarding ""Sequence Models"" course. Actually, quality of the courses is gradually declining, starting from 5 stars for very first course in specialization, ending with 2 stars for ""Sequence Models""."
11,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Videos are okay, but exercise is just debuging!"
12,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,5 stars for the very informative lectures.  I especially appreciated the amount of content related to de-biasing models.  Such an important step to take!
13,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The course is very good and has taught me the all the important concepts required to build a sequence model. The assignments are also very neatly and precisely designed for the real world application.
14,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Learnt a lot about new concepts in RNN and LSTM. Really wanted to learn about these models. This course helped a lot. Everything was new and so fascinating. Loved this course and our teach Andrew NG.
15,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Loved the course - it was very interesting. It is also pretty complex, so will probably go through it again to review the concepts and how the models work. Thank you for this wonderful course series!"
16,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Professor Ng seems a little bit confused about the subject and is making unnecessary analogies rather than going deep into the algorithm and explaining the context as he did in Convolution Neural Networks course. I hope that the videos are revised and professor explains the topic more clearly rather than depicting himself to be confused as well on the topic.
17,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great hands on instruction on how RNNs work and how they are used to solve real problems. It was particularly useful to use Conv1D, Bidirectional and Attention layers into RNNs and see how they work."
18,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Many topics are only quickly skimmed over. Serves as an overly brief introduction to RNN.
19,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The lectures covers lots of SOTA deep learning algorithms and the lectures are well-designed and easy to understand. The programming assignment is really good to enhance the understanding of lectures.
20,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,super unorganized!
21,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I'm blown away by how quickly this series of courses brought me from thinking a neural network was a magic box full of fairy dust, to being able to understand even the (al)most complex of network architectures and what makes them tick at every level at a glance. A lot of time has obviously gone into structuring this course; not an ounce of fat present and the format of developing intuition before diving into the nitty gritty and optional further learning resonates with me on so many levels. Thank you Andrew Ng and the team at deepmind.ai and coursera!"
22,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very good. I have no complaints. I though instruction was very  clear. Assignments were very helpful and challenging enough that I learned something, but not so challenging that I got stuck too often. "
23,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Hope can elaborate the backpropagation of RNN much more. BP through time is a bit tricky though we do not need to think about it during implementation using most of existing deep learning frameworks.
24,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I was really happy because I could learn deep learning from Andrew Ng.
25,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"If not Internet, I would not have been able to study a world-class Deep Learning course at an affordable price. Thanks Andrew and team."
26,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The only trouble with this course is that we're talking about seriously deep networks. That means it's difficult to present working, practical cases (jupyter notebooks) to work all the steps."
27,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This series of course provides a comprehensive overview of NLP algorithm and different applications. I really enjoy the projects the deal with audio files. The course skip the linear algebra and differentiation part that not everyone wants to look into. But I hope it will be better if we could also implement the data processing functions of different types of sequential inputs, since data preprocessing is also significant"
28,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"My knowledge has been upgraded to the next level through Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization. Through systematic and easy-to-understand explanations, quizzes, and program exercises, I was able to increase my interest and understanding of Deep Learning. Based on this, I really want to change my field of work and work related to Deep Learning. My goal is to make myself a person who uses AI without being replaced by AI."
29,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This was a great intro to RNNs and Sequence Models. 
30,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I had struggled with the complexity of Sequence Models ever since I started learning about Machine Learning models. This course gave me an easier intuition to the sequence models without dwelling too deep into the mathematical complexities. As a person who has very little experience with Linear Algebra this helped me a lot to understand and apply such architectures to solve problem. Thanks Prof Andrew and the team! :)
31,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I think it is a great course.  There are some issues here and there with notebooks and related materials.  However, considering the large and detailed amount of content in this course and it being a new course, things not being 100% perfect is OK by me.  I would rather have the thoughtful content and exercises, versus something much lighter that would be easier to produce.  Thank you to all who prepare these courses."
32,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Absolutely fantastic. I am Deep Learning professional focusing on Computer Vision and had worked in Vision all my life. I started learning multi-modal AI, and found that my foundations on Sequence Models was shaky. So I came here and learned much about them. Now I can continue my journey towards muti-modal AI such as CNN-RNN hybrid models for image captioning. Such lucid explanations! Andrew Ng is a great teacher."
33,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Superb course structure, the assignments beautifully complement the lectures and the amount of guidance makes it easy even for someone not too acquainted with programming. As a suggestion would have liked slightly organized detailed presentations which would help in reviewing the course material later by glancing through rather than going through the lectures. Over all an awesome course with great learning. Thanks   "
34,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I enjoyed learning all the five courses of this deep learning specialization. Special thanks should go to Dr. Andrew and the instructors for delivering the course material in an interesting manner. Quite frankly I'm a little bit disappointed with this specialization being too short. Expect more courses in this specialization in the future. (Maybe reinforced learning).Again thank you all for this great experience.
35,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I'm grateful for the chance to take the 5 courses in this program for a very affordable price.  It is the best educational deal I've ever come across.  The courses are well taught, I will continue on to take other courses offered online on the same subject.  Thanks to  everyone who made this possible, and I will definitely try to make a contribution to humanity as Prof. Ng has challenged us to do.  "
36,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Pretty interesting course, learned a lot about natural language processing using differen approaches for different input types. There were some challenges with completing the assignments, but they're managable by checking out the forums for help. Although I might not fully grasp the content material or algorithms, I still learned a lot or at least gain some familiarity through the lectures and assignments. "
37,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thank you Prof. Andrew Ng and team for these series of courses. The entire specialization was brilliant and the way the programming exercises were structured, using real-life examples was the best part of all. Prof. Andrew Ng always has a smile on his face when he explains the concepts and he is so humble that he thanks us for spending time doing the specialization, whereas it should be the other way round."
38,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I highly recommend this course to all audience. Professor Ng is an outstanding researcher with tremendous amount of experience. Moreover, he is a well-known lecturer in terms of his clear explanation and interesting examples provided in class. I have gained a lot of experience as well as knowledge in the field of deep learning. I am very grateful for his time and effort for providing all the resources here. "
39,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The best online course I've seen anywhere about recurrent neural networks! Prof. Andrew Ng explains everything in such a simple manner. For example, understanding the structure of LSTMs is quite challenging, but Prof. Andrew Ng explains it in a very easy to understand fashion. Likewise with GRUs, Seq2Seq models, bidirectional RNNs, etc. And the code exercises have very beautiful and detailed explanations. 

"
40,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thanks Professor Andrew Ng and team for the deep learning specialization. The course material was well designed for online learning. The assignments were perfectly manageable with a few hours of investment every week and the learning was very effective. Last but not least, I found Professor Ng's wisdom, insights, tips to be invaluable to anyone regardless of their level of expertise in machine learning."
41,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was the best course among 5 course specialization. It was well designed, structured and application oriented. Assignments were pretty fun to solve as they involved solving real world problems. This course gave me direct exposure to industry level problems and helped me gain more insights towards the future of deep learning. Because of this I am really excited to continue working in deep learning."
42,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Hello Andrew, I am a big fan of you. Learning from your every course. Very unfortunate that I can do that remotely only. "
43,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The Sequence Models course covers state-of-the-art deep learning methodology as of 2018. The instructor is awesome. The assignments help solidify concepts presented in lecture videos. One nitpicking comment. This course, being relatively new, was less polished compared to the other courses in Deep Learning Specialization. I'm sure future updates will eliminate glitches and errors in the near future."
44,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Good course to help you understand how sequence models work and how to apply them for various problems. Majority of topics are explained quite well. Practical problems sometimes could be a challenge, but every problem has hints and a bit of theory provided. Overall this course was  a very positive experience and I do recommend it. Special thanks for the people who made this course possible."
45,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I liked that this course was a bit harder than others in the specialization (well partly because It felt like notebooks were made in a bit of hurry here) but it was a good thing for me, since I had to think more on the programming excercises, read Keras documentation, derive backprop equations - and I believe such engagement with the topic really allows to understand and remember it better."
46,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It's been so rewarding to apply what I've learned in the previous courses of the Deep Learning specialization to time-based problems. I feel I have a better understanding of how some of the ""magic"" technology like virtual assistants and speech recognition work. While the material in the first four parts was also very useful, the specialization would have felt incomplete without this course."
47,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Where shall I start...? This module was by far the hardest I made, but I'm really glad I was able to finish it somehow (Searching of my own typos was quite challenging task and I thought my head explodes). Anyway this set of courses is great and I will continue further in my path exploring the world of AI. Thank you guys for the effort you spent to share your knowledge with us. Great job!"
48,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Another outstanding course about Deep Learning.
49,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course assignments were very interesing and engaging - clearly a lot of time has been invested in them.  The quizzes were not easy but also not too difficult.  The combined quizzes/assignnments helped reinforce the lectures.     As always, the lectures were great.  Perhaps one improvement would be to allocate another week for the transformers as this material was not as well explored."
50,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It's a great class, and Andrew Ng is a great instructor. I wish the exercises were a bit harder. Since the course is aimed at all and I am coming from a graduate degree in the sciences, I realize it's hard to cater to all educational backgrounds. I would have liked to see optional/honors exercises to get us more involved. Other than that, I loved the class. Thanks so much for teaching it."
51,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very effective mix of theory and practical examples, cemented by practice exercises in form of the programming assignments.  The guided instructions of the programming assignments are as valuable as the lectures.  I would recommend putting the ""errata"" readings *before* the videos containing the errors (as was done in an earlier course).  I also notice that some quiz questions pick up on nuances that were quite underplayed in the lectures, but going back over my notes, did find them."
52,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Smooth and hands-on walkthrough of basics of NLP and speech recognition. The flow of the course is very well-designed.
53,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Amazing course overall. Prof Ng's diagrams are the clearest explanations of DL models I have found anywhere and it's that clear a ton of thought went into planning the notations. The assignments are exciting and surprisingly fun. One could say that there is a little too much handholding throughout the assignments, but I understand that this course is more about the heuristics. Again, it's fantastic course overall and the resources provided throughout are truly unique to Coursera! "
54,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was my first AI course and I really made significant progress in my understanding of foundations of deep learning with this. Thanks to Professor Andrew's very informative course videos, grasping the complex concepts became possible. The quizzes and the assignments were challenging, made possible for me to use logic and develop new coding skills to go at it. I would recommend this course to everyone interested in AI/ML. Thanks to Professor Andrew for making this course."
55,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is an amazing course, it Provides a great Help...i have learned lots n lots of stuff  about NLP, Learn about recurrent neural networks that work extremely well on temporal data, word vector representations and embedding layers --that are explained in a concise manner, and more importantly I love the Attention mechanism, the  model that understand where it should focus...... its attention given a sequence of inputs.... amazing amazing ..highly Recommended.... Thankyou  "
56,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course was a great introduction to the world of RNNs. Starting from basic sequence models all the way through RNNs constructed with Convolutional layers, LTSM layers, GRU layers and wrapping up with the Attention Algorithm. It is great base work to start a Deep Learning career.  The course is very well structured and the resources in the forums were always life-saving. Very grateful for this course and I am waiting for the Advanced Specialization from Deeplearning.ai "
57,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Really good course for RNNs with NLP. Recommended to anyone who has completed the first four courses of the specialization. A thing to notice is that the last programming assignment is really hard to save and submit to your servers though it was pretty well organized.
58,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I really liked the whole Specialization, it is great: clear and interesting!"
59,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Another Excellent Course from Professor Andrew Ng. The detail in the explanations are excellent, and the provided exercises using Jupyter are super fun to complete and put to the test your knowledge offering you at the same time a library of ideas and models to use in your future projects. I enjoyed this last course in the specialization quite a lot, thanks very much to Andrew Ng and the Staff from Coursera. I hope to see more courses like this in the future.
"
60,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I love this course. Maybe about 1 and half year I was trying to learn DL. I thought about giving up because I wasn't able to learn, so, in May of this year 2020, Coursera opened its courses to undergraduates. I do not thought twice, at the same hour that I knew that news about free courses, I began this. Then, after that time I want to thank to Professor Ng and all colaborators on that site. One day I will be one of student of Professor Andrew Ng in Stanford. "
61,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A greatly knowledgeable course! I learned a lot about Natural Language Processing and explored RNNs, LSTMs, Word Embeddings, Seq2Seq Models, Attention Mechanism, etc. The course focuses more on the concepts along with providing the essential math. It was fun to implement Language Models, Neural Machine Translation & Speech Recognition. I would surely recommend this course to the ones who are diving into the world of NLP, and need a perfect introduction to it."
62,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A very systematic and well structured specialization course on deep learning by Andrew and team. The concepts are explained with a focus on intutiveness. The assignments and quizes help in understaind the concepts better and realising them with programming. Coming from zero backgrond of Deep learning to now being confident of using the concepts in my fututure research work, i would like to thank coursera and team Andrew for such a wonderful specialization."
63,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Another very good course, though not without its failings. Mainly, the Transformers' lectures and programming assignment were confusing and didn't go into enough depth to deliver the intuition."
64,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This end course is a little more  complicated than the previous ones, especially in programming homework. However,  it also inherits the merits of the special, gives learners the basic framework of sequence models. What impresses me most is the lesson of ""Debiasing word embeddings"", it shows that AI could be designed to do more against human stale thoughts, which sets up a  good principle for designing AI. Yes, it should be taught to new learners of AI."
65,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I d recommend this course to those who want to find their your paths as they are searching for what it is that makes their life fullfilling. The series of Depp learning specialization made me acquaitned many important technical, some fundumental and some advanced, aspects of AI world and standing here, now, I suppose I can think better about what I'm gonna do in the future."
66,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Finally... Every piece of effort was worth it! After so many hours, now I understand how proud we can fell of completing these amazing courses! The best one I have tried so far, definitely made a difference in my professional views but above all, it confirmed my expectations: this is the activity sector where I want to develop, the work in which I want to grow without any doubt."
67,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This regards all 5 courses of the DL specialisation.
68,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This was the most difficult and most interesting course i had in all of the five deeplearning.ai courses
69,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Will give this course also 5 stars. The assignments were easy but required some knowledge of Keras.  So you have to invest some time on their site.Otherwise it's like fitting  pieces in a bigger puzzle. Most pieces are already layed out for you .. you need to just fit your small ones. 
70,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Course contents and coverage was best. Duration of 3 weeks is little too short to really understand all the details of programming exercises.  May be extend this to 4 to 5 weeks and spend little more time on speech recognition, music generation and other audio data processing would have helped."
71,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"  Wonderful course, expert instruction from Prof. Ng.  I can't recommend the Specialization enough.   "
72,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"RNN, LSTM, GRU... fun stuff even you don't focus on NLP.  As always, Andrew makes complicated things simpler.  I certainly will keep all the course materials for future reference. "
73,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Sequence Models are a though subject. many people, during working meeting, mention them as the final resource and solution to everything.  I feel I better understand the nuances of them thanks to this course."
74,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I go back and forth on whether the time-saving aspects of the Python Notebooks are worth the reduction in ML coding experience. I suppose these aren't coding classes, but I also feel some of the concepts aren't cemented as well as if the students were led through a more challenging, trial-and-error experience. That's hard to do, though."
75,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Immensely grateful for holding this course, specially Prof. Ng. The way he explained the all concept to the mathematical models was very endearing and excellent."
76,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The first week is amazing. The last week is the worst! Andrew starts nicely; but as he goes to the second and third weeks, he hardly explains why he does what he does."
77,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Week 4 coding exercise is incomparably harder than any other in this entire specialization.  
78,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,The transformer subclass programming exercise is super useless task. Spent hours on this task and learnt nothing.  
79,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"If it could improve assignment accuracy, it will be better"
80,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,there are a lot of mistakes in programming assignments.
81,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"The course overall taught me new things, but I am still kinda unsure how to exactly use it. "
82,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Oversimplifying material, such as not showing any math foundations and proofs, does not lead to an intrinsic understanding of the material as well as fill-the-gap assignments do not enhance comprehension. "
83,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"I love Dr. Andrew, I seriously do. He has inspired me in the field of Deep Learning like no one else did. But I detest how this course is made so expensive and in a wrong direction. I subscribed and paid $225 and I still was not given a decent amount of time to finish the course, even when I asked for extension. If this is the way these courses are, its better of learning from youtube. It is not worth the money"
84,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Dry and uninformative. Immense space for improvement. Corrections should be made to videos instead of having numerous revisions comments after lecture. Some variables introduced haphazardly. Notation not explained well, some clashing with linear algebra conventions. Coding exercises are elementary hyper guided."
85,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Poor submission system. Failed many times to upload and had to redo the assignments. I was using a 250Mbps high speed network. Also course materials are problematic. The instructors are not willing to fix the problems for many years.
86,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Week 4 is impossible to follow both in lecture and in the assignements which is more than likely done intentionally as this is the last assignment before you can stop paying their monthly fee.
87,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Clearly the less structured and more confusing Course within the DeepLearning Specialization, a bittersweet end to an otherwise great set of courses. Quite disappointed."
88,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Not as good as other 4 courses of the specialization
89,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Programming assignments are completely useless. 
90,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"What to say after spending this whole weeks in the digital company of Andrew? :) Well, I have to words but to thank Andrew and the team for making the effort and putting all this together and pulling it off the way they did! I did already the NLP Specialization of DeepLearning.AI and wanted to learn more about the inner workings of neural nets and I was not a single minute disappointed by my decision! Extremely well done overall! In particular the course on Sequence models is very enjoyable and will give you all the tools and intuition necessary to understand the background and the basis of such models and how they work! You even have a last week on Attention-based models, which is a little bit introductory, given that Attention as a concept exploded after this course was developed. Nevertheless, it is very well executed! My only critique is that, the whole specialization was developed before TensorFlow 2.0, and later on it the assignments were ported and Keras is used. But during the lectures on will not find any introduction to Keras and all this content is left for the assignments. This requires from the student more effort to understand and use Keras. What can be a bit frustrating, because Keras API also evolved during this time. I would suggest adding a couple of videos or ungraded labs in order to teach the student a bit better how to use the framework. But well, this is a minor issue. 5 Stars are for the overall amazing presentation of what is indeed important, the Deep Learning fundamentals. Moreover, Andrews last video is just very much aspiring and a powerful message that everyone in the field should come in contact with! Congrats! I hope the team plan to execute soon an updated version of the specialization in order to incorporate the new advances and to adapt it to the newest DL Framework. Apart from that the theory videos are 5 out of 5. Clear recommendation!"
91,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A year ago I was basically ""on blank"" in regards of Machine Learning."
92,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is again a fantastic course and what a nice way to finish the Deep Learning Specialization. It is certainly the most difficult one from the whole specialization and has taken me a lot longer than I planned. This is partially due to the fact that focus is shifted a bit more towards the programming assignments and concepts that are only briefly mentioned in the lectures turn out to be crucial for the assignments. The forum helps a lot, without it I would not have  been able to crack the first week, especially the optional parts of the assignments. There were also a few errors in derivation formulas, that had set me back, but in the end I understood the concepts a lot better and found some nice complementary resources online. And the RNNs are more complex and seem more variable than other network architectures, so that is ok that this course is more difficult. Now I feel that I finally have a good grasp of Deep Learning concepts and have a nice set of skills. And the assignments are super fun and very useful. Thank you Andrew Ng and your team for making such a wonderful content. I teach at the university-level and I can only imagine how much effort goes into preparing such a course and at such a high level of expertise. I encourage everyone to take this specialization, this specialization is the main gem in Coursera, in my opinion.  "
93,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It is apparent how much thought and effort has been put into creating these courses.  Dr. Ng introduces you to state-of-the-art CNN and Sequence models which are quite complex.  But he expertly presents it to you so that you can focus on the essential aspects and not the details.  In courses 1-3, you might feel like you're being spoon-fed in the assignments but it is really a great approach to ease you into the deep learning field.  In courses 4 and 5, there is less guidance so that you can become more independent and be able to figure things out on your own.  After all, this is how it will be in our future jobs - no more TA's then.  "
94,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"From my perspective as a learner, there're two biggest""disaster"" they may encounter:"
95,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I really enjoyed the course. As usually Andrew and his team of dedicated professionals did a wonderful job of explaining an otherwise very hard material in an accessible way. The distinction of Andrew's classes is that they really give the *intuition* about why a particular approach works. Sure I may forget which particular regularization methods exist, but I will remember *why* and *when* to use regularization. The details can be always looked up elsewhere."
96,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"First of all, I thank Professor Andrew Ng for offering this high quality ""Deep Learning"" specialization. This specialization helped me overall to gain a solid fundamentals and strong intuition about building blocks of Neural Networks. I'm looking forward to have a next level course on top of this track. Thanks again, Sir!"
97,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This review applies to all of the courses in the Deep Learning Specialization. First, I want to thank Professor Ng so much!!! This Deep Learning Specialization was fantastic!! I feel more proud after completing this than I did after finishing the CPA exam!"
98,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A terrific set of courses that builds deep learning skills in neural networks.  The course guides the student through various time based models to address how speech recognition, music generation, sentiment classification, machine translation, video activity and name entity recognition."
99,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Dear Prof. Andrew, "
100,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"     In the beginning, I found the instructor a little difficult to understand, even though he is very good at explaining complicated concepts simply.  I am sure part of the reason is that I was unfamiliar with the technical terms.  Once I switched on the captioning option, my comprehension improved however I noticed an average of at least one translation error per video and these seemed to be caused by the instructor's accent and were sometimes very interesting errors.  So, I guess the system could use a little more training with the specific AI vocabulary and/or adjusting the context error settings for the subject matter."
101,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great finish to the specialisation. I have learned a lot of the core details of how to proceed with my own Deep Learning projects. My one piece of feedback would be for an intermediary step, that requires more of the programming myself, as a lot of the intricate coding has already been done."
102,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great selection of topics, clear explanations from Dr. Ng, and coding exercises to allow the understanding of the topics. Perhaps I would have liked to see some Time series analysis in the Sequential Networks parts, but even though, it was a great course.
Thank you Dr. Ng and all your team!"
103,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The course content is very good but the mistakes in the videos are being mentioned after the video. This is making us get confused a bit. It would be good if those errors are mentioned before the video itself so that we can look into that before watching the video and get prepared for that. 
104,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Excellent teaching, materials, and organization! It's great to include state-of-the-art technologies like Transformer and LSTM. I would recommend also teaching some practical skills (like TensorFlow) that students can apply directly in practical programming (beyond the course assignments)."
105,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great appreciation to Dr. Andrew Ng. The course has been incredibly well taught. Thank you so much for your enlightening lectures. I very much enjoyed the course, and I think it is very well structured and organized. The forum was very helpful when I got stuck in the programming exercises. "
106,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It is a great course, and the same applies to the whole Deep Learning Specialisation. It is  very nice to see that many people all around the world can relatively easily get access to these learning materials as well as to the problem exercises. Thank you for making it widely available !"
107,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I am amazed with the learning experience of Seq2Seq Modules created by deeplearning.ai team! Loved the way it's taught by Andrew Ng and the hands on experience helped the mentee very well. Keep building such courses, would like to contribute more in this space as in research or products."
108,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Insightful detail on model architectures and how they influence (and are influenced by) data generation for sequence-based applications. For those that have grasped the theory behind DNNs and are interested in applying ML to language and text, I highly recommend checking out this course!"
109,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course, well explained. Sometimes the course material gets a bit too general but this is done when the details would be unbearable to cover. The overview of all the machine learning conepts is an amazing start for purusing anything deep learning related in my novice point of view."
110,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I like the course. It's beneficial and clear. Also, the concept is clear. "
111,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course was really awsome,learning has been fun in all the 4 courses, the number of new things learnt in this course was remarkable.Even the mot complicated things were taught in such a way that it never seemed tough.Doing assignments really helped to make concepts even more clear."
112,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Fantastic course! Presents both the theory and practical uses in a straightforward manner that is easy to grasp. Programming assignments are a mix of NumPy and Keras API, with the former being more illustrative of the inner workings of RNNs and the latter being more practically useful."
113,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Excellent! Amazing! Such good quality of lecture and assignments. Thank you Andrew and team for giving me such a good overview of what i can use this for. I feel as though this series dramatically lowered the barriers to entry for me to get started on any ML project i decide to. Thanks
114,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,No better introductory material. I suggest doing NLP specialization by deeplearning.ai after this though I have still not tried it out myself yet but hoping to do it some time. Thank you Andrew! I got emotional in your last video of the course. You are such an example for educators <3
115,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This was by far the Best Course and Specialization that I have done. Thank You Coursera and Thank You Sir Andrew NG . You have made me confident and able in the Field of Deep Learning. I am grateful to you Sir. I will try my best to use this knowledge as a superpower in the right way.
116,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,1) Course over all is good.
117,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"In my opinion, this module was a little more complex than the previous ones, however, it has been an excellent course to deepen my knowledge in recurrent neural networks and close this specialization program in deep learning. Thank you very much, Dr. Andrew Ng and deeplearningai!!!!"
118,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course with interesting exercises. One can really see the amount of effort  being put into creating the assignment material, so they are at a suitable level and with a lot to take away, and the students have a good understanding of details through practice. Really appreciated."
119,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I don't know how to express my feeling of gratitude. The DeepLearning Specialisation to some degreee, changes my life, including career and reserach. I will definitely make fully use of this superpower to improve humanity and the whole community! Thank you again to deeplearning.ai!"
120,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,the programing assignment ins WEEK 1 was a bit ambiguous in nature. helped me improve my debugging skills. 
121,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,More easier to understand than the ConvNets course!
122,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is a great course. It provides a good introduction to RNNs and how they are used in sequence modeling. Introduction to GRU, LSTMs, BiRNNs, attention model is great way to learn these in depth. The exercises are designed to make you familiar with the internals of these layers."
123,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I can't thank Andrew Sir and Coursera enough for enabling me with this wealth of knowledge in NLP. With this I can dive deeper into NLP and look at a career change as well into this area. The course has immensly boosted not only my knowledge but also my confidence. Much obliged.
124,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"At the beginning this is very counter-intuitive. But later on when I am on the final assignment, I finally realized that we are not focusing on gradient descent, but architecture building and training set assembling!  When everything start to make sense, it is really intriguing."
125,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course made me have great understanding around the Sequence Models such as GRU, LSTM, Attention, etc. I had a lot of fun while completing programming exercises such as Trigger word detection. As always, it was one of the best class ever. Thanks Professor Andrew Ng and all-!"
126,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Comencé esta especialización sin conocimientos de deeplearning en absoluto, hoy habiendo finalizado la especialización tengo una basta noción de este mundo tan apasionante. Quiero destacar la facilidad con la que Andrew transmite su conocimiento, es un instructor de otro mundo!. Feliz de haber realizado la especialización y de continuar por este camino. Gracias a Andrew Ng. y a Coursera."
127,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is an incredibly great course for learning Deep Learning. The course lecture videos and the programming exercises are both so well designed! By learning this course, I have got a comprehensive understanding of Deep Learning framework, as well as the hands-on experience of using deep learning to solve real-world applications. Thank you for providing this wonderful series of courses."
128,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Loved the course, Andrew is a great teacher; very impressive ability to explain and give intuition. I can really see how I can build upon this course to help me in what I am doing at work. I think there is definitely some room to go deeper on some of the topics e.g. don't just teach sequence to sequence but also broader uses of recurrent networks. Maybe a follow-up course? ... please???"
129,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,First of all I would like to thank all of the people given me opportunity to follow this course. This is the toughest course I followed so far with latest greatest technology stack in 21st century. Over the past few months I gained a lot of knowledge and experience from all of the courses and I hope now I can apply the knowledge of deep learning specialization for my future projects.
130,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This module of the specialization is a bit more complicated than the others; at least to me, I found the concepts more difficult to grab."
131,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I was about to give this course a 3-star rating unlike the other courses in the specialization, which I have rated 5 stars. The reason for that was the programming exercises in week 1. They are not interesting and do not impart a lot of learning. Please consider improving those. The reason I still gave 5 stars is because of the amazing programming exercises in weeks 2 & 3. Thank you."
132,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I have completed all the courses of the specialization and learned a lot. My motivation for this was not professional advancement, as I am only a few years away from the end of my professional career, but pure interest. Interest in one of the most exciting topics of our time. Thanks to everyone at Coursera, especially Andrew NG for all the interesting insights into machine learning."
133,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,It was really wonderful course. From here i had learn most important algorithms like LSTM and GRU. I had learnt how to deal with sequence model. Hope I will be better perform on different data.I am really really thankful to coursera to provide such legend teacher. Once again thanks for this beautiful course. Now i had clear my goal. I want to be something in the field of ML and Ai
134,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"In the continuity of the 4 previous modules, the Sequence Models course is of very high quality, the material is concise but cover a wide range of applications and methods, and is delivered with consistent clarity. The programming assignment gives very good hands challenges. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in natural language processing or speech recognition."
135,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is the last course of the Deep Learning journey, and I felt like a learned a lot in it. Sequence Modelling is a different beast compared to non-time series models, but I've mastered it thanks to this course nevertheless. I would recommend this particular course to anyone who has a moderate understanding of deep learning and wants to get into time series analysis and nlp."
136,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A succinct overview of a number of ideas in sequence models. Some of these were covered in an NYU course I took 4 years ago (embeddings, LSTM), others I had heard about but hadn't had a chance to look into (attention). The assignments were set up to be pretty easy, but I think trying to do them from scratch rather than by filling in code would make for a pretty good project."
137,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It is a well designed course (especially for week 1 - week 2) which gave a comprehensive view of the sequence model. However, week 5 material can be better and clearer. To be specific, additional hints can be given in the coding exercise. Video can be better aligned with the material in the coding exercise.  Thank you Andrew and all the contributors for this amazing course!"
138,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great introduction to sequence models/RNNs. The real-world examples were very illuminating. Again, as with the previous course in the specialization, I felt some details of how to run/predict NNs using keras were lacking, which could leave a student floundering if they've never used keras before. This is in contrast to some other, much easier, tasks where hints were given."
139,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Out of 5 courses offered I think this was the most exciting one as it combines everything learnt so far and teaches how to combine different NN modeling techniques to achieve desired classification/prediction features . For example, it is pretty much clear how one would  go about building an app that would describe a picture to blind people and do that in many languages. "
140,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This short 3 weeks courses will make you work a little, exercice take at least twice the time write. You will learn about the famous LSTM, and how to use it on various tasks."
141,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is a great course, and a great specialization. The professor explains the concepts across very well, not only in this course but in all courses of the specialization. My only gripe is with the notebook/hub/grading system which especially in this course has acted strange and cost a lot of time. That said I've learnt a lot, and am quite happy with the course content. "
142,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Great course overall to learn the basics of sequence models and also get a brief understanding of the state of the art architectures used currently. The programming assignment on trigger word detection gives an insight into the practical machine learning implementation for speech recognition. This course combines both theory and practical advice in a very good fashion.
143,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Excellent course - and specialization! Andrew Ng's special talent is in being able to explain complex and difficult stuff with such clarity that you can actually understand it and follow. I found the exercises in this course tougher than in the previous four, but they were varied, useful, and FUN! Highly recommended to all who what to learn the ""deep"" in Deep Learning!"
144,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Because my research direction is NLP, so I think this course is very good for me. I learn how to implement the Sequence model such as machine translation 、Attention and so on. But the disadvantage is that there is no whole sequence model process. For me, The bigger problem is data processing and model. overall ,This course is good for me, I learned many from this."
145,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It was a great specialization and a great course, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to learn from you special thanks to Dr. Andrew Ng for his exemplary efforts and for teaching the greatest courses of the machine learning technology, I'm really proud of myself for finishing that specialization and I'm so grateful for all of you. Thank you ,Coursera."
146,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Very clear delivery of material and lots of tips for real world applications. Appreciate the hard work that Andrew and everyone who contributed to the course material and mentors on preparing an amazing specialization. Machine learning is not the most straightforward subject to learn and having such a well structured course goes a long way in getting us started.
147,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The whole specialization is excellent. I highly recommend doing it. The only minor comment that I add is that Andrew should include some links for further reading (along the courses for each topic or theme). I know that anyone can quickly look up for them in the Internet (and they can be outdated) but that would make the specialization even better in my opinion.
148,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is Course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization, and the last one. We learn Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) /Sequence Model, which allow translation or trigger word (like ""Hey Siri!""). It's a completely different beast than CNN seen in Course 4. Again, nice videos and explanations, and well-designed useful programming assignment (TensorFlow/Keras and numpy)"
149,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:," I Highly recommended this course on Sequence Models. The course is easy to follow as it gradually moves from the basics to more advanced topics, building gradually. Andrew Sir makes the cocepts behind the scenes about LSTM GRU etc very easy to understand. Assignments are great, extremely well designed. Best assignments you will ever get to practise and learn."
150,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"  The kind of simplicity with which the course is explained and the amount of knowledge gained is worth the hard work of many months!
.
.
I would like to thank the whole Coursera team and Sir Andrew Ng for creating such a wonderful platform and a big shout-out to all the mentors and community who have replied to the most basic queries in the discussion section.  "
151,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Home work assignment notebook has a quick time out issue. It's quite annoying since most of the assignment has lots reading material to fully understand the topic or method. Often the notebook just time out and has to be restarted before move to the next section. Hopefully, it can be fixed or improved."
152,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was truly an exceptional course on neural networks. Although created several years ago, i havent seen a better course on coursera yet. The course went through all aspects of all types of neural networks, was very detailed and explanatory, apart from the last week of the last course - transformers work. Highly advised for all machine learning engineers.   "
153,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,It took me a longer time to finish the course due to busy schedule. But I found it totally worth the struggle to work on the course material. Sequence modeling and processing is an new area to me. The course taught me some basic concepts and gave me a chance to lay hands on through programming exercises. I feel a lot like the topic particularly NLP. Thanks!
154,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Très largement plus difficile que tout ce qu'il y a eu auparavant. Un véritable apprentissage et un plaisir surtout sur le Trigger Word Detection qui était très intéressant.
155,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Exercises too basic. Better to do something simpler from scratch, them fill in the blanks on statements like ""define a to be a boolean variable initialized to True"", and run a bunch of other cells with imported code that hides the actual complexity. These kind of exercises does not add anything to the student. Content of Andrew's lessons is great, however. "
156,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This course helped get a good intuition as well as further specifics of voice recognition which is what I am most curious about. 
157,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course provideed a good introduction to sequence models and deepened my understanding about RNNs, LSTMs and Transformer networks. The programing exercises helped improve my understanding of the concepts introduced in the lectures, and some of them were also very fun to implement and see how sequence models can be used in real-world applications."
158,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"  Thank you Prof Andrew Ng for sharing the knowledge and experience. It has been truly a great learning during the course specialization. And I always admire the way you structure the course and teach the advanced concepts with such an ease.  With the power of AI, we as a community try to solve real-world challenges for better life.  Thank you so much! "
159,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"awesome! Thanks to Andrew and his time to deliver this wonderful course. It  really give me a very good sense about what's going on with the Deep Learning in several areas. The course material is prepared in a way that it's very easy to catch up. Just one suggestion, this sequence model session is too short, lots of topics haven't got well deployed. "
160,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very very interesting but it's a lot more difficult than the other courses.  I did it out of sequence (no pun intended) (i.e. I skipped Convolutional networks to go straight to RNN, because they interest me more)."
161,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The class lectures are easy to follow and programming practices showcase a good variety of interesting implementation/practice of sequence models. Not only does it introduce how models work and are constructed but also illustrate how those models can be applied to real-life problems (e.g. voice detection in smart home, music generation...etc.,)."
162,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I have earlier completed first 3 courses of the Deep Learning Specialization. This course widens the horizon of deep learning applications. Through the assignments, I have gained confidence in understanding the model architecture and the underlying theory behind it. I recommend every to enroll for this course if they want to learn how RNN works. "
163,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great lectures on the intuitions behind RNN and their applications in real life. It requires some self-exploration to complete the programming assignments related to Keras and tensor, but the structure of the assignment is very good. I have learned a lot from this lecture and it helped me to understand the language of the field of deep learning."
164,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Awesome course, with lot of detailed and well guided practices! After finishing all of them I went directly to look on GANs and Transformers and with the knowledge gain thanks to Andrew Ng and his team, I set up my local Jupyter with tensorflow-gpu and start using state-of-the-art machine learning! Check out paperswithcode for awesome projects!"
165,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I decided to do this course after reading the first few pages of the Deep Learning book by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville. I'll probably go back to that book now, to reinforce what I learnt from this set of 5 courses. I plan to also get more practice with the programming frameworks. The Tensorflow specialization is probably my next conquest."
166,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course is really fantastic. It teaches several of the most important contemporary applications of deep learning, and mentions lots of important points of these models."
167,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Many thanks to Professor Ng, this is absolutely the best online course that I've taken. It is fantastic how much value he creates for all of the learners, conveying very complex ideas from the world of deep learning in a simple and understandable way. I hope one day I will meet Professor Ng and thank him in person. An amazing specialization!"
168,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Finally, after 6 months achieved desired goal in Deep Learning Specialization."
169,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Excellent as always. This subjectcould easily take more weeks or even months to understand, but Andrew explains complicated concepts in very easy terms. Though sometimes it seems a bit esoteric and magical, due to how easy he makes it sound, it's a great start point to begin to investigate, read and implement the most important algorithms."
170,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course challenged me. It forced me spend more time on the things you really need to understand before moving forward. Frustrating of course, but the reward is golden. It also tells me I need to learn more Keras. I was really inspired by the exercises, by all the things you actually can create by using the superpowers of deep learning."
171,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Excellent. I am doing a research on LTSM application for process plant data and asset health prognostics and the materials I found on the web were usually a bit ""dry"". The course enabled me understanding the concept mechanics and keras code basics to start using on my own applications - What else I could have asked for :D ?"
172,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I had a lot of fun doing these courses and weekly programming assignments. 
173,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I am grateful to Professor Andrew Ng. and the entire team of deeplearning.ai for giving me the platform to learn, practice and showcase the deep learning concepts in such an elegant and concise manner. The journey has truly been educative and enlightening and I look forward to applying the concepts and skills in my further endeavors. "
174,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Andrew's ability to make complex topics so easy to understand is amazing. His explanation of the 'intuition' behind complex stuff makes you really understand what is going on and why. Very happy with the course, it provided everything I needed to know to understand it in detail and implement it. Thanks Andrew for making this course. "
175,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very useful course for me, since I am doing research in Natural Language Processing. As NLP require RNN  and its variants as its implementation, this course helped in implementing my task using the Seq2Seq model. Explanation about each topic is very clear. With respect to mathematical equations, all the models are neatly explained."
176,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is definitely a top-flight course and supremely useful!  I learned many new things about practical applications of recurrent neural networks in this class and found the natural language emphasis to be very useful, particularly for certain problems I have been working on for some time!  Professor Ng's lectures are very well-organized and clear and follow a very logical sequence.  The assignments, especially the programming assignments, are well designed and do a very good job of building upon what is taught in the lectures and add a great deal of value to this class.  I especially like the fact that we worked so much with Keras, which is an important framework for building Deep Learning systems and which is so widely used (it is the framework I often use in my own projects), and I acquired a lot of new knowledge about Keras thanks to this course.  Overall, it was a superb learning experience, and I will be recommending this to both friends and colleagues."
177,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Good set of courses on Deep Learning.  Some small complaints / recommendations: 
178,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"During the past couple of months, I worked on this Deep Learning Course Specialization Course by deeplearning.ai (through Coursera). I think is a great course for everyone that is interested in learning more about this topic and not only the theoretical aspects but also from a practical point of view. Andrew NG does an excellent work by going through the theory and then leaving some time for the practical exercises which are the best and, at the same time, the most challenging part of this specialization. These exercises start with very basic stuff but quickly turn into interesting problems related to convolutional neural networks, face recognition and end up with sequence algorithms for natural language processing.
"
179,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I'm Zeyad, an undergraduate of Computer Engineering at Alexandria University in Egypt. "
180,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Nesse curso você vai ficar maravilhado com a capacidade científica do ser humano em transformar as redes neurais em máquinas de se comunicar com humanos. As ligações semânticas e contexto das orações e palavras são tornadas inputs matematicamente convertidas em tensores. Para procurar seu correspondente sentido e significado esses tensores são reconvertidos em um processo complexo envolvendo várias etapas e fases. Na saída dos pipelines de algoritmos vc encontrará  sentido e significado, que possam traduzir para outra língua ou até mesmo dar respostas e por fim, conversar de forma natural. No mecanismo de atenção você aprenderá como programar seus dispositivos de monitoração de ambientes que possam entregar informação concreta sobre o que está acontecendo."
181,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It was an amazing course. From the beginning to the end, Andrew Ng has laid out all of the parts of the course extremely well. Of course, given the nature of RNNs and their complexity, it will also take your effort to make sure that you understand what he is talking about. Another note about the assignments, previous reviews have mentioned some of the problems and how the previous courses had better structured assignments. I think that the deeplearning.ai team has done a tremendous job of improving the content of this course assignments. At moments, it feels like you are lost, but deep explanations make sure that you understand everything and are able to implements all of the parts of the system that you have to implement. Please take this course!  "
182,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I like the way Andrew introduce the topic. From the easier cases to the more difficult ones.
183,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great topics and discussion, however the lectures started to gloss over the details of implementation which were left entirely to the exercises."
184,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I learned what this course says it to be. There are many interesting topics and new ways to do things. This course is quite advanced. If you have been in similar fields you may find a lot of connection, such as, time encoding in the transformer networks. You will learn how to incorporate time axis, time dependency, auto-correlation (you name it) to formulation of a machine learning problem using neural networks. I highly recommend this course if you need a systematic treatment of recent advances in speech recognition, machine translation, natural language processing, and more. The padding and blank words also are interesting way to pre-process or post-process. You will earn a lot of bells and whistles too. "
185,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great introduction to sequence models! Andrew as usual goes into detail on some seminal architectures that have shaped deep learning sequence models over the past ~decade. 

One feedback: I wish there was a week dedicated to doing just backprop and gradient computations for plain RNNs as well as LSTM-cell based RNNs. The latter is covered to some degree in the programming assignment as an ungraded part, but I don't think that is enough justice to the topic.

Also, another feedback: sometimes keeping track of the dimensions of the various entities in play was very difficult for me. Perhaps 10-15 minutes dedicated to explaining just that would be helpful to students.

All in all, a fantastic course though!"
186,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It was an unbelievable journey through this Deep Learning Specialization! I really felt the power of the tools I obtained during the past 3 weeks that it took me to pass all 5 courses of the specialization. Many of the Programming Assignments are demanding and in the end I could be extremely satisfied that I succeeded in taking them all. Thanks a lot to Andrew Ng and all involved for making this sequence of courses accessible to people like me, and presenting it in such an understandable and interesting way! Now, I can start thinking of the vast potential for using Deep Neural Networks not only in Research and Space Sciences, where my interests are, but also in my daily life. Very many thanks again! AJ"
187,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The whole series was excellent but in particular this last course on RNNs. Thank you for not skipping the mathematical details and letting us figure out backpropagations through time and how Adam works under the hood and explaining LSTMs and Attention so well. There was even a notebook on Attention! And the dinosaurus notebook was cool but the jazz improvisation really blew me away: the music actually sounded really nice! :) Also, thank you for pre-training the models to safe us time and teach us how to resume training from learned weights! The quizzes were helpful in developing an intuition and the price point was more than fair. Perfect series, Andrew, thanks a lot!"
188,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Another excellent course, well presented, with compelling content.  My only concerns are regarding the labs.   With no previous Python or Keras experience, I found I needed to spend a lot of time coming up to speed on new programming domains in order to complete the assignments (my previous experience is mainly C).   While this was somewhat an issue in the previous courses in the Specialization, I found it particularly so in Sequence Models.  This distracted from the main objective of understanding the core NN algorithms.   I would recommend either: 1) advising students to have a solid background in Python, or 2) a bit more clarity on how to use the Keras functions in the labs."
188,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very good course. In quite short time you get understanding of a lot of principles and intuitions. The pace is good, explanations are consistent and clear, top-down approach from generic to specific, from simple to complex, very good instructional videos and interesting projects"
189,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Previously, I have taken online classes before in Machine Learning by going the cheap route (Udemy, blogs, youtube) and you get what you pay for. Andrew Ng explains it the most thorough, easiest, and simplest way possible.  Presentation material is very understandable. Great class for new machine learning learners. Highly recommend it. The only downside is that the programming exercises are little too easy in my opinion. I feel like the best way to get your hands dirty is to do actual projects (do your own projects). These lectures are good for intuition and background of different types of Neural Network architectures. Other than that, Great material. Thanks Andrew!"
190,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A very good course. It presented gated units like GRU and LSTM with so much simplicity that anyone can understand it on the first run. The downsides were the Jazz music generation, since it was the only task where the data is non intuitive (MIDI files) so you black-box apply the algorithm to a data you have no idea how it is structured, unless, of course, you are familiar with MIDI files prior to this course. Other than that, the learning curve was a bit slower in the beginning, but explodes by the end of the course, where you put all the subjects you've learned to perform a neural machine translation, which, in my opinion, was hugely awesome and rewarding."
191,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Like all other course in this specialization, this is also indeed a great course. It fundamentally clears concepts and gives very clear concpts for topics such as RNN and LSTM, which can ohterwise can be difficult to digest. Also, the programming excersices, built on great topics, suh as Music synthesis, Trigger word activation, are exciting to work on. The only feedback I would like to suggest, is that topics of Backpropogation for sequence model is critical and should have been taken up indepth in study rather than left to excerciss only. Overall this course is more fast paced and packed 3 weeks which should have been perhaps a 4 week course."
192,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course teaches in-depth knowledge of sequence models in natural language processing and speech regocnition . The programming excercises and the quizzes provide more content to furthur your grasp on the matter . The progamming exercises being totally in Keras , provides a clear analogy of how LSTM s and GRU s , work along with attention models introduced in the last week. You also have to implement  a LSTM and RNN from scratch in Numpy , which provides for the basic knowledge how these architectures actually work. Overall , it was a great experience and taking this course should be a pre-requisite for all learning in NLP. "
193,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Whew! This was very interesting and challenging. I have a huge backlog of things I need to go back and read up on and better understand. I really appreciate the work that Andrew and his team put into these courses.  The lectures were very well paced and clear. His temperament is exemplary for a teacher and his subject knowledge comes across.  I found the exercises really well thought out and beautifully crafted. The coding style could not have been more clear and the consistency made it understandable despite the complexity of the subject and the limited time to delve into the mechanics of Keras and the Python tools. Bravo!
194,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The last course is in this series does not disappoint. I found this course to be more difficult than the others; likely because I had very little prior exposure to recurrent neural networks. However, this course is worth the effort as it opens up a realm of new possibilities; text, audio & time-series data. Whether you need to detect, classify or translate sequences, or even generate new sequences in the vein of some examples, this course is for you. There are several high-level APIs for performing these tasks but having a deeper understanding of what these APIs are doing is invaluable to your success. Take this course."
195,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"An extremely well thought off and comprehensive introduction to sequence models, with examples taken from the most important/interesting application domains. Andrew NG's clarity of exposition is absolutely wonderful on such an otherwise complex area. The assignments are very cleverly chosen and helped me to finally get to grips with Keras. This being a new course, the assignment notebooks had a few minor issues that are well known by now and documented in forums and erratas, and will likely be fixed in subsequent reruns. Nevertheless, given the breadth and quality of the content, 5 starts are absolutely well deserved."
196,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was, in my opinion, the best of the 5 courses. Actually, here's how I'd rank the courses (from best to worse): "
197,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course, undoubtedly, has the toughest assignments compared to all the previous courses. The content is rich and informative. Again, pay close attention to the hints given in the programming exercises. If you don't follow, check the Discussion Forums to get a hint. Professor Andrew, your teaching is absolutely sublime - Crisp and concise. Personally, I would have loved an entire week dedicated to Attention Models as the entire concept seemed a bit rushed. Other than that, I have absolutely no qualms! For the people who are enrolling for THIS course only - make sure you're pretty good with Python and Keras."
198,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Remarkably lucid exposition of complex learning architectures with directly applicable programming exercises.  Highest recommendation. Thanks to the deep learning.ai staff for putting this entire specialization together and sharing their abundantly clear mastery of the subjects.
199,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Some of the lectures were not quite up to par with professor Ng's standard.  Some of the programming assignments were hard to follow and missing some details.  Nevertheless, I came away with good understanding of sequence models and RNN.  I can't thank enough.  5 stars from me."
200,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is very logical and especially the addition of probability between the words to improve predictions.  It will be interesting to compare language , which language is easier to predict and why and study backward- how human creates them.  We might learn something unexpected."
201,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The lectures were super informative. It's almost unreal how easily he explains such difficult concepts, such they look a child's play. The coding assignments are incredibly informative and super interesting. I am very thankful for this specialization that it taught me so much"
202,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Before starting the course, I wanted to have a strong knowledge of the basics of Natural Language Processing as I wanted to specialize in this domain. I am thoroughly satisfied at the end of this course. This course has given me the confidence to dive deeper into this domain."
203,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Course of lectures are excellent, but please fix the following problem"
204,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I'll remain forever indebted to Andrew and his team for preparing this rigorous course. I can imagine the effort put in designing video lectures, going through research papers, crafting out these well-knit coding exercises. He has democratized AI and education in true sense."
205,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Such a great course. It explains everything from scratch and teach you how to code in numpy (scratch) and how to code in keras to build high performance system (instead of tiny datasets).
206,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This a the last and the most anticipated course for me. It's hard, informative and most useful. I've got chance to learn some popular and powerful methods within the years, like word embedding and attention mechanism. I start to understand the way deep learning community deal with NLP, i.e., ingenious design of network structure inspired by the pattern human beings perceive the world. It doesn't enjoy solid foundation as statistical learning does, but is works and suitable for engineering. That's astonishing! I hope I can combine deep learning with traditional methods to better understand NLP."
207,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I just want to say Thanks to Andrew and the team for a great content. I may not be able to create award winning NLP models after this course, but I have learned a bunch about them. Lots of work went into creating great videos and even more in creating the programming projects. I really appreciate the format of the programming assignments. For someone with not much experience in DL, they were pretty close to perfect: I felt I was not left to fend for myself, yet they were not overly simple and forced me to solidify what was thought in the lectures and learn better. Thank You Andrew and team!"
209,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I appreciate all the hard work and
effort Andrew and his team puts in all his material."
210,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A great introduction to Recurrent Neural Network models with lots of examples (text generation, music generation, sentiment analysis, word embedding, speech recognition, attention-based machine translations etc.). Thanks a lot to Andrew and the team for this awesome course. "
211,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Andrew, again explained complicated structures very clearly. The first week might be a bit overwhelming and you might get lost with huge information overflow, but trust me, in week2 and week3 you will see how the dots are connected. Thank you Andrew for this amazing course."
212,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thanks for making this course! I have been through all the courses in this specialization, and they are really excellent! Andrew has a great way of explaining things simply. It was easier for me to look at a couple of research papers after having gone through the lectures."
213,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Prof Andrew such a great person. He teaching from the heart where 99 % of Prof not doing it today. 
214,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Awesome. But the programming assignments need to be less erroneous and lectures and assignments could contain more technical and mathematical details to build the foundations. The programming assignments could be designed to allow the students to do more that spoonfeeding.
215,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was for me the best course on the deeplearning.ai series since I am a complete novice regarding sequence models. Nonetheless, I have managed to learn a lot and the material was very good (with often state of the art techniques). The assignments were excellent as well! "
216,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I really liked this last course as I did not have much experience with NLP and with audio in general, as I did have with computer vision and image processing. The keyword detection model is really cool! After this specialization I am starting to build my own ML projects!"
217,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is the hardest course in the specialisation, and may take some extra effort. For practical assignments I recommend getting familiar with Keras syntax and workflow, as here there is little hand-holding here,. the focus is on actual model architecture and algorithms."
218,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is not a good course, and even not a good tutor.. It is a great course and Andrew is really incredible tutor... I like this course so much and got tons of benefits... "
219,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I really enjoyed the models presented in the course, as well as the accompanying exercises; I think Andrew and the team did a good job at giving intuition about the problems and coupling that with enough hands exercises to give better understanding of the implemtations"
220,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Greatly explained. A lot of things explained in detail in just no that-much videos. Totally worth-it the specialisation!! Went from zero knowledge to know a lot of things about how it really works. Learned python (including keras and tensorflow) along the way as well.
221,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Thanks for an enlightening course about sequences and how to apply machine learning concepts. This course has brought new light to how to solve some difficult sequencing tasks in my day to day work and I plan on looking for future courses from Andrew Ng in the future!
222,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thank you for this amazing, indepth, structured course that has explained and ensured the understanding with resourceful vedios by Andrew Ng  Sir,  and quizzes  that check our understanding  and organized assignments. Thank you for the team for this wonderful course. "
223,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course is well structured! Dr Andrew Ng teaches very well all the concepts in the videos and also references to the papers. Along with the programming exercises, we can put in practise all the concepts from the videos. The exercises are also very well documented."
224,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was by far the most challenging and most interesting course of all the courses in the specialization. Really gives your brains a hard time, but after you see/hear (haha) the results, it seems that all that was worth the effort!!! THANKS ANDREW, for everything!!!"
225,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Very good course as all run by Andrew Ng :)
226,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Amazing course and what a finish line. I only with the graded assignments are revisited as few of them have bugs in them. Also I hope the Word2Vec algorithm and word embedding in general is explained better and with exact steps.
227,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Awesome course and specialization. Now, to implement everything I learned in my own programs, and of course I will be sure to revisit the videos until everything becomes second nature. Learn, program, improve and repeat. Thanks!"
228,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This course is excellent to get a start of deeplearning.
229,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was particularly intensive course of this whole series, learned a lot. "
230,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I have many of books and blogs related to RNN, but was not clear and confident about it. And after studying only the first week video and lectures, I am so confident and happy that cant tell you!!! Thank you so much Andrew...;)"
231,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It seems like there are several and very useful RNN models. Many of them are very good at specific tasks, and if you take this course you will be abe to understand and implement many of them. It was a really amazing experience."
232,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,An excellent introduction to the theory and practice on recurrent deep neural networks. Great usage of all the 4 courses in this series to culminate with this course as a great finish to deep learning theory and implementation.
233,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Yet another amazing class!  I'm so grateful for the existence of these classes.  It makes mastering deep learning very much easier. My thanks to Andrew, and all others who have worked so hard to make this course possible!   :-)"
234,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Most notably, an exercise guides one through the building of a recurrent network from scratch. More exercises show the value of different architectures and make the learner proficient in using neural network libraries (Keras)."
235,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It felt like an actually great course to understand what is what in deep learning world. So after this course there're still plenty things to learn, but now you will now at least what exactly why and when you should focus on."
236,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was quite a tough one.. But it was almost magical when the outputs of the assignment were successfully completed. Excellent. The discussion forums helped a lot, as the instructions were not very clear to novices like me. "
237,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great explanation of hard material, still wish there were more assignments, and they were more complicated and less guided, or start with simple assignment and increase the complexity and eliminate the guidance in next ones."
237,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I think it is the best courses designed so far. Gives you exactly the appropriate amount of information needed to understand basics behind sequence models. A must do course for all the students who want to pursue a career in this field.
238,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Amazing course, Andrew Ng presents the material in a concise and intuitive manner. It would be nice to have access to all of the material needed to fool around with the assignments on our computers in an offline environment."
239,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thank you for this wonderful sequence of courses! This whole concept is still a bit blurry for me, but as a lot of people during the interview have mentioned, one must simply exercise new skills to understand the technology. "
240,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,It's great course to get concepts right and overview. It will be great if you add further programming assignments(other than partially coded ones)  or resources as such where one can practice what he had learned as optional.
241,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great choice of material, i would be happy to have one more week of that course to see more examples and have more time to familiarise with the concepts. All weeks were very useful and all the material was greatly explained."
242,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I enjoyed all the courses of the specialization but I was looking forward to Sequence Models the most. I think a lot has been covered in this course and I can't wait to try working on projects with the knowledge I now have.
243,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course is good , I learn RNN,LSTM,GRU etc.Just one thing, the last assignment is hard to submit.I guess maybe there is a systematic problem that need to be solved. Everything except that is great. Thanks a lot, Andrew."
244,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Andrew Ng does an excellent job of explaining and teaching various sequence models in a format that any layman can understand.  I really enjoyed this course and look forward to taking more corses with Mr. Ng and his staff in the future.
245,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Finally, I finished all the courses of the specialization within 4 weeks! Great courses, and I will recommend everyone I met who wants to learn ML and DL to go and see this series of courses. Thank Andrew Ng and course assistant as lot!"
246,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This is my last course of deep learning specialization class. I've learned the hottest topics in AI fields. I am really appreciate the Prof. Ng for his wonderful teaching and excellent lectures and hard work. Thanks a lot to COURSERA. 
247,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Excellent course. The instructor is able to teach difficult concepts in a very simple way which make them very easy to understand. Enjoyed the programming assignments. Looking forward to any course Andrew Ng might teach in the future.
248,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,¡Excelente curso! Llegar hasta acá haciendo la especialización vale el esfuerzo. Andrew Ng como siempre un gran maestro.
249,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Amazing course, highly recommended for learning about sequence models. It also covers transformers which are a relatively new topic. The labs also give you a a great introduction to using tensorflow to create and train your models."
250,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"the course is really well made, just enough theory and lots of practical labs.  Although it does not go deep in the theoretical explanation, it develops intuition and triggers a curiosity to go further and continue to learn.  "
251,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"My only constructive criticism is: more difficult homework, or more homework in general. The programming assignments seem very important for internalizing concepts, and this course covers a lot of material in a short period of time. "
252,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,A very efficient way to help me go through quite a difficult course with many linear algebra. Really thanks to the super power that you empowered me.
253,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It wasn't easy to finish. Comparatively 3 weeks only, but the content is hard. Compared to Computer Vision techniques, NLP techniques are harder to develop an intuition around. But a great learning experience. Interesting projects."
254,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is an excellent course for a beginner like myself. I would like to thank Andrew for making this course available to everybody in the world. Thank you so much for your inspiring course. With best regards, Seungbum Hong."
255,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This course has helped me in developing an understanding for implementing sequence models through Recurrent Neural Networks that can be used in number of applications such as Natural Language Processing and Audio detection.
256,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A briefly introduction of Sequence Models to solve sequence problem, such as translation, speech reorganization..etc. Homework is also very helpful to understand what is going on step by step under Recurrent Neural Network. "
257,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This is an excellence training course! I had a wonderful experience learning the leading edge Artificial Intelligence knowledge specialized with Deep Learning and believe this will make a life-long impact to my career path!
258,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This Specialization is flawless. Yet I wish C5 W4, Transformer assignment, had more explanations, didn't have a couple of bugs, and had a cell for inference time experience with the model. All in All, 99 out of 100. Thanks "
259,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Excellent Course! The maths and concepts were a bit tough to understand and I had to look up some(a lot) of stuff but the learning experience and the thrill of actualling building and training the model is very satisfying
260,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"My favorite by far, and I'm not a fan on NLP. Sequence Models, especially attention mechanisms seem to have so much potential. Interested in using them to look at time series data analytics for industrial iot applications."
262,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Every course with Andrew is worth it. He is great at explaining details and providing examples even for quite complex topics.
263,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,A very good course on Sequence Models starting from the basics to designing a trigger word detection model. I will surely recommend the course if you are a deep learning enthusiast or you want to brush up your skills in this field.
264,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Excellent material; though VERY dense. Notebooks still have some issues, but forums are really helpful. I feel that first 3 courses were much better prepared; though CNNs/RNNs are still super-useful despite not being 100% polished."
265,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Really funny section about sequence model with interesting examples, helping me to understand how to learn the pattern of sequence data and transfer it to useful information. arouse my curiosity about other application in this area"
266,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Amazing set of courses.  Learned a ton of information that I will directly use at my current work and beyond.  And Andrew is a fantastic teacher that really engages with his students (despite this being an on-demand online course).
267,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I enjoyed this course thoroughly. Excellent platform to start  Deep Learning. This course has touched almost every concept of deep learning. It has provided me the solid base now I am confident enough to take it to the next level.
268,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course was very well structured from the basics of RNN progressing slowly towards LSTM, GRU, word embedding and attention model finally. Kudos to the instructor and the team for providing such a good course on sequence models."
269,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thank you Andrew! Learned great things from this deep learning specialization course. The knowledge and certification I gained will help long way, in shaping my career. Thanks once again to the creators of this wonderful course :)"
270,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Amazing job once again by Andrew and his team. The world needs much more of this! Specially more implementations that can be put into use easily in real-life apps and projects. Now we know the theory, we can put it into practice. "
271,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I have learnt a lot from this course and it is very interesting to be part of this course as i understood the concepts of NLP in deep learning which is the most fascinating technology to learn and implement in real world problems
272,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The first week of this course is maybe the most harder week of all the Deep Learning Specialization. But,  with Sequence Models I have understand infinite better the great possibilities of this techniques for improving the world. "
273,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course, programming assignments become more interesting in the later section of the specialization. Really get you thinking ! Had a lot of fun learning these skills through the entire 5 courses, would definitely recommend."
274,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"After finishing this course, I'm so fired up by the potential projects I can build with this knowledge that I feel adrenaline coursing through my veins. Thank you Prof. Andrew Ng. Thank you Deeplearning.ai team. You're the best."
275,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The Course was Excellent. Sir's teaching was Excellent. I understood the techniques of Sequence Models and Natural Language Processing. The Programming Assignments were Excellent.  The Deep Learning Specialization was Excellent.
276,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The only trouble with this course is that we're talking about seriously deep networks. That means it's difficult to present working, practical cases (jupyter notebooks) to work all the steps."
277,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This series of course provides a comprehensive overview of NLP algorithm and different applications. I really enjoy the projects the deal with audio files. The course skip the linear algebra and differentiation part that not everyone wants to look into. But I hope it will be better if we could also implement the data processing functions of different types of sequential inputs, since data preprocessing is also significant"
278,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"My knowledge has been upgraded to the next level through Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization. Through systematic and easy-to-understand explanations, quizzes, and program exercises, I was able to increase my interest and understanding of Deep Learning. Based on this, I really want to change my field of work and work related to Deep Learning. My goal is to make myself a person who uses AI without being replaced by AI."
279,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This was a great intro to RNNs and Sequence Models. 
280,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I had struggled with the complexity of Sequence Models ever since I started learning about Machine Learning models. This course gave me an easier intuition to the sequence models without dwelling too deep into the mathematical complexities. As a person who has very little experience with Linear Algebra this helped me a lot to understand and apply such architectures to solve problem. Thanks Prof Andrew and the team! :)
281,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I think it is a great course.  There are some issues here and there with notebooks and related materials.  However, considering the large and detailed amount of content in this course and it being a new course, things not being 100% perfect is OK by me.  I would rather have the thoughtful content and exercises, versus something much lighter that would be easier to produce.  Thank you to all who prepare these courses."
282,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Absolutely fantastic. I am Deep Learning professional focusing on Computer Vision and had worked in Vision all my life. I started learning multi-modal AI, and found that my foundations on Sequence Models was shaky. So I came here and learned much about them. Now I can continue my journey towards muti-modal AI such as CNN-RNN hybrid models for image captioning. Such lucid explanations! Andrew Ng is a great teacher."
283,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Superb course structure, the assignments beautifully complement the lectures and the amount of guidance makes it easy even for someone not too acquainted with programming. As a suggestion would have liked slightly organized detailed presentations which would help in reviewing the course material later by glancing through rather than going through the lectures. Over all an awesome course with great learning. Thanks   "
284,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I enjoyed learning all the five courses of this deep learning specialization. Special thanks should go to Dr. Andrew and the instructors for delivering the course material in an interesting manner. Quite frankly I'm a little bit disappointed with this specialization being too short. Expect more courses in this specialization in the future. (Maybe reinforced learning).Again thank you all for this great experience.
285,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I'm grateful for the chance to take the 5 courses in this program for a very affordable price.  It is the best educational deal I've ever come across.  The courses are well taught, I will continue on to take other courses offered online on the same subject.  Thanks to  everyone who made this possible, and I will definitely try to make a contribution to humanity as Prof. Ng has challenged us to do.  "
286,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Pretty interesting course, learned a lot about natural language processing using differen approaches for different input types. There were some challenges with completing the assignments, but they're managable by checking out the forums for help. Although I might not fully grasp the content material or algorithms, I still learned a lot or at least gain some familiarity through the lectures and assignments. "
287,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thank you Prof. Andrew Ng and team for these series of courses. The entire specialization was brilliant and the way the programming exercises were structured, using real-life examples was the best part of all. Prof. Andrew Ng always has a smile on his face when he explains the concepts and he is so humble that he thanks us for spending time doing the specialization, whereas it should be the other way round."
288,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I highly recommend this course to all audience. Professor Ng is an outstanding researcher with tremendous amount of experience. Moreover, he is a well-known lecturer in terms of his clear explanation and interesting examples provided in class. I have gained a lot of experience as well as knowledge in the field of deep learning. I am very grateful for his time and effort for providing all the resources here. "
289,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The best online course I've seen anywhere about recurrent neural networks! Prof. Andrew Ng explains everything in such a simple manner. For example, understanding the structure of LSTMs is quite challenging, but Prof. Andrew Ng explains it in a very easy to understand fashion. Likewise with GRUs, Seq2Seq models, bidirectional RNNs, etc. And the code exercises have very beautiful and detailed explanations. 

"
290,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thanks Professor Andrew Ng and team for the deep learning specialization. The course material was well designed for online learning. The assignments were perfectly manageable with a few hours of investment every week and the learning was very effective. Last but not least, I found Professor Ng's wisdom, insights, tips to be invaluable to anyone regardless of their level of expertise in machine learning."
291,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was the best course among 5 course specialization. It was well designed, structured and application oriented. Assignments were pretty fun to solve as they involved solving real world problems. This course gave me direct exposure to industry level problems and helped me gain more insights towards the future of deep learning. Because of this I am really excited to continue working in deep learning."
292,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Hello Andrew, I am a big fan of you. Learning from your every course. Very unfortunate that I can do that remotely only. "
293,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The Sequence Models course covers state-of-the-art deep learning methodology as of 2018. The instructor is awesome. The assignments help solidify concepts presented in lecture videos. One nitpicking comment. This course, being relatively new, was less polished compared to the other courses in Deep Learning Specialization. I'm sure future updates will eliminate glitches and errors in the near future."
294,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Good course to help you understand how sequence models work and how to apply them for various problems. Majority of topics are explained quite well. Practical problems sometimes could be a challenge, but every problem has hints and a bit of theory provided. Overall this course was  a very positive experience and I do recommend it. Special thanks for the people who made this course possible."
295,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I liked that this course was a bit harder than others in the specialization (well partly because It felt like notebooks were made in a bit of hurry here) but it was a good thing for me, since I had to think more on the programming excercises, read Keras documentation, derive backprop equations - and I believe such engagement with the topic really allows to understand and remember it better."
296,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It's been so rewarding to apply what I've learned in the previous courses of the Deep Learning specialization to time-based problems. I feel I have a better understanding of how some of the ""magic"" technology like virtual assistants and speech recognition work. While the material in the first four parts was also very useful, the specialization would have felt incomplete without this course."
297,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Where shall I start...? This module was by far the hardest I made, but I'm really glad I was able to finish it somehow (Searching of my own typos was quite challenging task and I thought my head explodes). Anyway this set of courses is great and I will continue further in my path exploring the world of AI. Thank you guys for the effort you spent to share your knowledge with us. Great job!"
298,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Another outstanding course about Deep Learning.
299,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course assignments were very interesing and engaging - clearly a lot of time has been invested in them.  The quizzes were not easy but also not too difficult.  The combined quizzes/assignnments helped reinforce the lectures.     As always, the lectures were great.  Perhaps one improvement would be to allocate another week for the transformers as this material was not as well explored."
300,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It's a great class, and Andrew Ng is a great instructor. I wish the exercises were a bit harder. Since the course is aimed at all and I am coming from a graduate degree in the sciences, I realize it's hard to cater to all educational backgrounds. I would have liked to see optional/honors exercises to get us more involved. Other than that, I loved the class. Thanks so much for teaching it."
301,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I think the course and specialization are special. It requires a lot of hours to finish it. It can be a great review of specific topics in the deep learning subject. Thank you for allowing us to reach those specific topics easily. Great content
302,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course explains the fundamentals of RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs in a very easy manner with plenty of illustrations and programming exercises. Although, some of the exercises are optional but doing those actually help reinforce essential concepts. "
303,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Très intéressant. Les papiers scientifiques illustrés dans les travaux pratiques sont récents et cela fait plaisir de comprendre comment marchent ces réseaux de neurones de notre quotidien (traduction google, trigger word, style transfert, ...)"
304,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"State-of-the-art and in-depth content, inspiring and engaging lectures throughout the whole specialisation. I will be eternally grateful to all of you who created this (and the other) courses. Thank you, Coursera, thank you so much, Andrew Ng! "
305,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Very useful for understanding what 'sequential' means in DL. I expected as some new solution to the time series scenarios but it turns out a different area from the quantative techniques. It might be helpful applied to more 'sequential' areas. 
306,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"  Yes, I have just finished the whole specialization. I'm very proud of myself. And I recommend this specialization to anyone who wants to start with this field. Andrew is the best one I've seen who able to explain the thing in deeper way. Thanx   "
307,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A wonderful, intellectual experience!"
308,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"""I think that every person whether you come from a wealthy family, or a low income family, or anywhere in between. I think everyone should have great opportunities. "" (socioeconomic status)"
309,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course was brilliant! Even though, the programming assignments could be better (personal opinion). The teaching itself is brilliant, and I think Andrew NG is by far one of the best Deep Learning teachers for anyone looking to get started."
310,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,very nice course but bit comprehensive especially Sequence models.
311,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,More lectures are needed in the sequence models to make these models or ideas clear to deep learning learners.  I found this course is the most difficult one to follow in this series even if I got quite a lot experience on time series topics.
312,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It was a great learning experience. Thanks Andrew Ng for the wonderful content. However, there are still some mistakes in the programming assignment such as in the expected output of 3rd assignment. Kindly correct it. Overall very satisfying!  "
313,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course is superbly organized and there is a lot of material covered. I recommend it to everyone. However, one has to count with progressively more difficult assingments. Especially the last one on Transformers was really, really tought. "
314,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"  It's an amazing course, the video lectures are fruitful and the contents of the courses are well designed, the instructor is talented and his explanations are extremely helpful, it's one of the best courses taught on keras!"
315,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Great course! I  feel some great accomplishment having finished this specialization I began 2 months ago. This one course could use a bit more of Keras hints or optional Keras course for those who do not have a  regular use of the framework.
316,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course is great if you want to know about sequence models for areas like nlp and speech recognition. They provide assignments that is solvable and their forum is active, and you can always find people solved your confuse on assignments. "
317,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The video lectures are awesome. But the project is too fast-paced. I feel I am just following the instruction and keras doc, instead of understanding how keras works. Testing me how to create dict in Python didn't make me feel happy. Thanks!"
318,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I think considering the other courses, Sequence Model course was a little bit faster and it covered a lot of topics, so it was a little tough to keep up. But what I learnt was quite a lot and I think it is is quit a very good course indeed."
319,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course: material, instructor, assignments, everything! Perfect way to introduce or consolidate your knowledge in recurrent neural networks to model sequence data with a really strong component of direct industry-relevant application."
320,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Well structured and easy to comprehend. 
321,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Feels great to complete this wonderful journey. Once again thank you Andrew Sir for creating this type of novel courses, great to have you as an instructor. Hope I someday would build a great model of my own, and get a chance to meet you!  "
322,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very good, by necessity it's a little hand-holdey but otherwise it would take an unreasonable amount of time to cover the material. Hopefully I'll be able to leverage the background i gained in the specialization in future job experience."
323,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Excellent Overview of Deep Learning. I did a PhD in AI 30 years ago and this was a great introduction to the latest research. I highly recommend to beginners and old timers like me to get up to date on the latest research and techniques.
324,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course give me opportunities to dive in to RNN and other architectures relating to NLP. Although it is a little bit tougher than 4 previous courses (in this specialization), it provides several interesting applications in real life."
325,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This is perhaps the toughest one so far. I still feel happy to see that NLP revolutionised deep learning. Things like attention and transformers were created for NLP tasks and now they play a major role in every branch of deep learning
326,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Comencé esta especialización sin conocimientos de deeplearning en absoluto, hoy habiendo finalizado la especialización tengo una basta noción de este mundo tan apasionante. Quiero destacar la facilidad con la que Andrew transmite su conocimiento, es un instructor de otro mundo!. Feliz de haber realizado la especialización y de continuar por este camino. Gracias a Andrew Ng. y a Coursera."
327,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is an incredibly great course for learning Deep Learning. The course lecture videos and the programming exercises are both so well designed! By learning this course, I have got a comprehensive understanding of Deep Learning framework, as well as the hands-on experience of using deep learning to solve real-world applications. Thank you for providing this wonderful series of courses."
328,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Loved the course, Andrew is a great teacher; very impressive ability to explain and give intuition. I can really see how I can build upon this course to help me in what I am doing at work. I think there is definitely some room to go deeper on some of the topics e.g. don't just teach sequence to sequence but also broader uses of recurrent networks. Maybe a follow-up course? ... please???"
329,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,First of all I would like to thank all of the people given me opportunity to follow this course. This is the toughest course I followed so far with latest greatest technology stack in 21st century. Over the past few months I gained a lot of knowledge and experience from all of the courses and I hope now I can apply the knowledge of deep learning specialization for my future projects.
330,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This module of the specialization is a bit more complicated than the others; at least to me, I found the concepts more difficult to grab."
331,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I was about to give this course a 3-star rating unlike the other courses in the specialization, which I have rated 5 stars. The reason for that was the programming exercises in week 1. They are not interesting and do not impart a lot of learning. Please consider improving those. The reason I still gave 5 stars is because of the amazing programming exercises in weeks 2 & 3. Thank you."
332,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I have completed all the courses of the specialization and learned a lot. My motivation for this was not professional advancement, as I am only a few years away from the end of my professional career, but pure interest. Interest in one of the most exciting topics of our time. Thanks to everyone at Coursera, especially Andrew NG for all the interesting insights into machine learning."
333,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,It was really wonderful course. From here i had learn most important algorithms like LSTM and GRU. I had learnt how to deal with sequence model. Hope I will be better perform on different data.I am really really thankful to coursera to provide such legend teacher. Once again thanks for this beautiful course. Now i had clear my goal. I want to be something in the field of ML and Ai
334,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"In the continuity of the 4 previous modules, the Sequence Models course is of very high quality, the material is concise but cover a wide range of applications and methods, and is delivered with consistent clarity. The programming assignment gives very good hands challenges. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in natural language processing or speech recognition."
335,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is the last course of the Deep Learning journey, and I felt like a learned a lot in it. Sequence Modelling is a different beast compared to non-time series models, but I've mastered it thanks to this course nevertheless. I would recommend this particular course to anyone who has a moderate understanding of deep learning and wants to get into time series analysis and nlp."
336,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A succinct overview of a number of ideas in sequence models. Some of these were covered in an NYU course I took 4 years ago (embeddings, LSTM), others I had heard about but hadn't had a chance to look into (attention). The assignments were set up to be pretty easy, but I think trying to do them from scratch rather than by filling in code would make for a pretty good project."
337,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It is a well designed course (especially for week 1 - week 2) which gave a comprehensive view of the sequence model. However, week 5 material can be better and clearer. To be specific, additional hints can be given in the coding exercise. Video can be better aligned with the material in the coding exercise.  Thank you Andrew and all the contributors for this amazing course!"
338,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great introduction to sequence models/RNNs. The real-world examples were very illuminating. Again, as with the previous course in the specialization, I felt some details of how to run/predict NNs using keras were lacking, which could leave a student floundering if they've never used keras before. This is in contrast to some other, much easier, tasks where hints were given."
339,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Out of 5 courses offered I think this was the most exciting one as it combines everything learnt so far and teaches how to combine different NN modeling techniques to achieve desired classification/prediction features . For example, it is pretty much clear how one would  go about building an app that would describe a picture to blind people and do that in many languages. "
340,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This short 3 weeks courses will make you work a little, exercice take at least twice the time write. You will learn about the famous LSTM, and how to use it on various tasks."
341,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is a great course, and a great specialization. The professor explains the concepts across very well, not only in this course but in all courses of the specialization. My only gripe is with the notebook/hub/grading system which especially in this course has acted strange and cost a lot of time. That said I've learnt a lot, and am quite happy with the course content. "
342,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Great course overall to learn the basics of sequence models and also get a brief understanding of the state of the art architectures used currently. The programming assignment on trigger word detection gives an insight into the practical machine learning implementation for speech recognition. This course combines both theory and practical advice in a very good fashion.
343,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Excellent course - and specialization! Andrew Ng's special talent is in being able to explain complex and difficult stuff with such clarity that you can actually understand it and follow. I found the exercises in this course tougher than in the previous four, but they were varied, useful, and FUN! Highly recommended to all who what to learn the ""deep"" in Deep Learning!"
344,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Because my research direction is NLP, so I think this course is very good for me. I learn how to implement the Sequence model such as machine translation 、Attention and so on. But the disadvantage is that there is no whole sequence model process. For me, The bigger problem is data processing and model. overall ,This course is good for me, I learned many from this."
345,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It was a great specialization and a great course, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to learn from you special thanks to Dr. Andrew Ng for his exemplary efforts and for teaching the greatest courses of the machine learning technology, I'm really proud of myself for finishing that specialization and I'm so grateful for all of you. Thank you ,Coursera."
346,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Very clear delivery of material and lots of tips for real world applications. Appreciate the hard work that Andrew and everyone who contributed to the course material and mentors on preparing an amazing specialization. Machine learning is not the most straightforward subject to learn and having such a well structured course goes a long way in getting us started.
347,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The whole specialization is excellent. I highly recommend doing it. The only minor comment that I add is that Andrew should include some links for further reading (along the courses for each topic or theme). I know that anyone can quickly look up for them in the Internet (and they can be outdated) but that would make the specialization even better in my opinion.
348,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is Course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization, and the last one. We learn Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) /Sequence Model, which allow translation or trigger word (like ""Hey Siri!""). It's a completely different beast than CNN seen in Course 4. Again, nice videos and explanations, and well-designed useful programming assignment (TensorFlow/Keras and numpy)"
349,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:," I Highly recommended this course on Sequence Models. The course is easy to follow as it gradually moves from the basics to more advanced topics, building gradually. Andrew Sir makes the cocepts behind the scenes about LSTM GRU etc very easy to understand. Assignments are great, extremely well designed. Best assignments you will ever get to practise and learn."
350,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"  The kind of simplicity with which the course is explained and the amount of knowledge gained is worth the hard work of many months!
.

I would like to thank the whole Coursera team and Sir Andrew Ng for creating such a wonderful platform and a big shout-out to all the mentors and community who have replied to the most basic queries in the discussion section.  "
351,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,An Amazing course which Imparts lots of knowledge.
352,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is a great course, it gave me a good overview of how various types of data (written text, speech, images/video) are used in neural network models. The course materials smartly omit complexities behind pre-built deep learning models, and provide students with hands-on examples, which spark creativity and imagination. Thank you!"
352,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very good course. In quite short time you get understanding of a lot of principles and intuitions. The pace is good, explanations are consistent and clear, top-down approach from generic to specific, from simple to complex, very good instructional videos and interesting projects"
353,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course is great and it builds on the last 4 course of deep learning specialization. It contains many nice topics of deep learning like RNN, NLP etc. There are some nice assignments also which you can relate with the real world. The whole Deep Learning specialization is great and every topic is nicely explained by Sir Andrew Ng."
354,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Excellent Course on Sequence Models and training on how to use RNNs for practical applications. All the programming exercises were pretty fun and highly informative giving hands on experience on the use of a variety of sequence models. I would like to thank Professor Andre N.G. and his team for developing such a wonderful course.
355,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,very helpful course if you want to become a professional in the field of deep learning. It will enhance not only your conceptual skills but also your programming skills to write code for complex deep-learning models. The sequence model will give you a deep understanding of all the concept related to voice text emojis and models.
356,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very Interesting course, well explained even if the topics are somehow difficult at certain points. Good and interesting Labs reflecting practical cases. But the problem was in Lab ""Trigger word detection"" where I encounter the error of not opening the lab and I try to solve it many times using the given solution before the lab."
357,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great! I would really love some signal dynamics task in this course, maybe some predictor or estimator. As an engineer I am very interested in these applications. Thank you Andrew, and huge thanks to the entire team. I am sure you guys had an extremely hard time building the programming tasks, but it looks great and helps a lot!"
358,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Dear Prof Andrew Ng and deeplearning.ai team, Sequence Models is yet another excellent course where I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about new and powerful concepts of Deep Learning. The course content, quizzes and programming assignments are of the very highest quality. I am deeply grateful to the entire team. Thanks a lot! "
359,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Really an awesome course. A bit difficult to grasp in three weeks. But,  Prof. Andrew Ng  has tried his best to make the content lucid. I am great full to all the faculty members for offering such an excellent course. I personally feel that if course can extended for another week then it will easier to understand the concepts."
360,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very good course to learn things about Deep learniing.  I think the Andrews courses keptmy interestin the courses with the video, quizes, assignments. I wish  to challenge participants further, there should be (non-gradable) exercises  based on the available util functions and contents. I mean where one has todobit more work."
361,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Awesome course. I did not know what it meant by Deeplearning at the start of the program, but now I'm confident on finding a way. Thanks prof Andrew NG and all the Instructors and team for organizing such a rich content. You probably have put a great effort. It was challenging but fully worth. And recommending to anyone !!"
362,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great lectures on the different structures of Sequence Models for use in Natural Language Processing, Text Translation, and Audio Recognition. There is a lot of material packed into 3 weeks, but this course will help anyone familiar with Deep Learning/CNNs to take a dive into the world of NLP and audio/speech recognition."
363,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This Sequence Models and RNNs course was a very challenging course in the specialization similar to that of Convolution Networks. I've learned a lot on these topics, and I will continue expanding my knowledge from here on."
364,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"After having completed the Deep Learning Specialization i can say it was definitly worth it! Always top notch content, i have learned so much from these courses. I would strongly recommend them to anyone who has 0 to some knowledge of AI but has interest in the area. Thank you to the staff and everyone for this course."
365,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Remarkably lucid exposition of complex learning architectures with directly applicable programming exercises.  Highest recommendation. Thanks to the deep learning.ai staff for putting this entire specialization together and sharing their abundantly clear mastery of the subjects.
366,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Some of the lectures were not quite up to par with professor Ng's standard.  Some of the programming assignments were hard to follow and missing some details.  Nevertheless, I came away with good understanding of sequence models and RNN.  I can't thank enough.  5 stars from me."
367,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is very logical and especially the addition of probability between the words to improve predictions.  It will be interesting to compare language , which language is easier to predict and why and study backward- how human creates them.  We might learn something unexpected."
368,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The lectures were super informative. It's almost unreal how easily he explains such difficult concepts, such they look a child's play. The coding assignments are incredibly informative and super interesting. I am very thankful for this specialization that it taught me so much"
369,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Before starting the course, I wanted to have a strong knowledge of the basics of Natural Language Processing as I wanted to specialize in this domain. I am thoroughly satisfied at the end of this course. This course has given me the confidence to dive deeper into this domain."
370,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Course of lectures are excellent, but please fix the following problem"
371,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I'll remain forever indebted to Andrew and his team for preparing this rigorous course. I can imagine the effort put in designing video lectures, going through research papers, crafting out these well-knit coding exercises. He has democratized AI and education in true sense."
372,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I appreciate all the hard work and
effort Andrew and his team puts in all his material."
372,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is definitely a top-flight course and supremely useful!  I learned many new things about practical applications of recurrent neural networks in this class and found the natural language emphasis to be very useful, particularly for certain problems I have been working on for some time!  Professor Ng's lectures are very well-organized and clear and follow a very logical sequence.  The assignments, especially the programming assignments, are well designed and do a very good job of building upon what is taught in the lectures and add a great deal of value to this class.  I especially like the fact that we worked so much with Keras, which is an important framework for building Deep Learning systems and which is so widely used (it is the framework I often use in my own projects), and I acquired a lot of new knowledge about Keras thanks to this course.  Overall, it was a superb learning experience, and I will be recommending this to both friends and colleagues."
373,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Just finished the last class of the specialization.  It's amazing how far we came during the 5 classes. I'm so impressed with the way it builds from first principles into high level discussions of state of the art DL.  And now they have released updates to all the classes.  Can't wait to see what enhancements they made,"
374,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The topics covered in this course were a bit on the advanced side. The technologies used are most frequently used in the area of NLP. The course helps understand the basic concepts of NLP like word vectors and embedding, at the same time explains the very complex concepts like LSTM, GRUs and Attention models very well. "
375,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was an excellent course to learn about sequence models.  We were able to not only examine standard RNN structufre, but GRUs, LSTMs, and Dr. Ng included the most recent innovation in the field by adding in study of Transformes.  I would highly recommend this course. I intend to pursue more studies in these topics."
376,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I completed the entire specialization and having nothing but good things to say. Highly recommend it! Lectures are engaging, and Andrew does a fantastic job explaining some very complex topics. Programming assignments are challenging in a good way. You’ll really feel like you’ve learned a lot by the time you’re done."
377,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course is perfect to learn deep insights of natural language processing, word2vec, speech recognition, trigger word detection and sentiment analysis among others. This course not only trains in using open-source libraries, but also trains to learn how to implement these life-changing techniques all by ourselves. "
378,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Deep learning specialization is one of the best courses I've ever done. When I used to work on Computervision prior to this course, I used to stumble a lot conceptually and in implementation. This specialization gave me a pragmatic insight into the DL. Can't thank coursera, deeplearning.ai and instructors anymore. :) "
379,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"What an awesome course it was? I have completed my Deep Learning Specialization. It was a about three month journey with Coursera and Andrew Ng. I really miss Andrew. I suppose, I will see you, Andrew  Ng, in another Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera course. Till than, I am waiting what will come from you."
380,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This course gives an in depth explanation and intuition of RNNs used for learning tasks involving Sequences. 
381,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A great introduction to Recurrent Neural Network models with lots of examples (text generation, music generation, sentiment analysis, word embedding, speech recognition, attention-based machine translations etc.). Thanks a lot to Andrew and the team for this awesome course. "
382,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Andrew, again explained complicated structures very clearly. The first week might be a bit overwhelming and you might get lost with huge information overflow, but trust me, in week2 and week3 you will see how the dots are connected. Thank you Andrew for this amazing course."
383,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thanks for making this course! I have been through all the courses in this specialization, and they are really excellent! Andrew has a great way of explaining things simply. It was easier for me to look at a couple of research papers after having gone through the lectures."
384,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Prof Andrew such a great person. He teaching from the heart where 99 % of Prof not doing it today. 
385,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Awesome. But the programming assignments need to be less erroneous and lectures and assignments could contain more technical and mathematical details to build the foundations. The programming assignments could be designed to allow the students to do more that spoonfeeding.
386,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was for me the best course on the deeplearning.ai series since I am a complete novice regarding sequence models. Nonetheless, I have managed to learn a lot and the material was very good (with often state of the art techniques). The assignments were excellent as well! "
387,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I really liked this last course as I did not have much experience with NLP and with audio in general, as I did have with computer vision and image processing. The keyword detection model is really cool! After this specialization I am starting to build my own ML projects!"
388,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is the hardest course in the specialisation, and may take some extra effort. For practical assignments I recommend getting familiar with Keras syntax and workflow, as here there is little hand-holding here,. the focus is on actual model architecture and algorithms."
389,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is not a good course, and even not a good tutor.. It is a great course and Andrew is really incredible tutor... I like this course so much and got tons of benefits... "
390,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I really enjoyed the models presented in the course, as well as the accompanying exercises; I think Andrew and the team did a good job at giving intuition about the problems and coupling that with enough hands exercises to give better understanding of the implemtations"
391,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Greatly explained. A lot of things explained in detail in just no that-much videos. Totally worth-it the specialisation!! Went from zero knowledge to know a lot of things about how it really works. Learned python (including keras and tensorflow) along the way as well.
392,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Thanks for an enlightening course about sequences and how to apply machine learning concepts. This course has brought new light to how to solve some difficult sequencing tasks in my day to day work and I plan on looking for future courses from Andrew Ng in the future!
393,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Good set of courses on Deep Learning.  Some small complaints / recommendations: 
394,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"During the past couple of months, I worked on this Deep Learning Course Specialization Course by deeplearning.ai (through Coursera). I think is a great course for everyone that is interested in learning more about this topic and not only the theoretical aspects but also from a practical point of view. Andrew NG does an excellent work by going through the theory and then leaving some time for the practical exercises which are the best and, at the same time, the most challenging part of this specialization. These exercises start with very basic stuff but quickly turn into interesting problems related to convolutional neural networks, face recognition and end up with sequence algorithms for natural language processing.
"
395,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I'm Zeyad, an undergraduate of Computer Engineering at Alexandria University in Egypt. "
396,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Nesse curso você vai ficar maravilhado com a capacidade científica do ser humano em transformar as redes neurais em máquinas de se comunicar com humanos. As ligações semânticas e contexto das orações e palavras são tornadas inputs matematicamente convertidas em tensores. Para procurar seu correspondente sentido e significado esses tensores são reconvertidos em um processo complexo envolvendo várias etapas e fases. Na saída dos pipelines de algoritmos vc encontrará  sentido e significado, que possam traduzir para outra língua ou até mesmo dar respostas e por fim, conversar de forma natural. No mecanismo de atenção você aprenderá como programar seus dispositivos de monitoração de ambientes que possam entregar informação concreta sobre o que está acontecendo."
397,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It was an amazing course. From the beginning to the end, Andrew Ng has laid out all of the parts of the course extremely well. Of course, given the nature of RNNs and their complexity, it will also take your effort to make sure that you understand what he is talking about. Another note about the assignments, previous reviews have mentioned some of the problems and how the previous courses had better structured assignments. I think that the deeplearning.ai team has done a tremendous job of improving the content of this course assignments. At moments, it feels like you are lost, but deep explanations make sure that you understand everything and are able to implements all of the parts of the system that you have to implement. Please take this course!  "
398,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I like the way Andrew introduce the topic. From the easier cases to the more difficult ones.
399,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great topics and discussion, however the lectures started to gloss over the details of implementation which were left entirely to the exercises."
400,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I learned what this course says it to be. There are many interesting topics and new ways to do things. This course is quite advanced. If you have been in similar fields you may find a lot of connection, such as, time encoding in the transformer networks. You will learn how to incorporate time axis, time dependency, auto-correlation (you name it) to formulation of a machine learning problem using neural networks. I highly recommend this course if you need a systematic treatment of recent advances in speech recognition, machine translation, natural language processing, and more. The padding and blank words also are interesting way to pre-process or post-process. You will earn a lot of bells and whistles too. "
401,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great introduction to sequence models! Andrew as usual goes into detail on some seminal architectures that have shaped deep learning sequence models over the past ~decade. 

One feedback: I wish there was a week dedicated to doing just backprop and gradient computations for plain RNNs as well as LSTM-cell based RNNs. The latter is covered to some degree in the programming assignment as an ungraded part, but I don't think that is enough justice to the topic.

Also, another feedback: sometimes keeping track of the dimensions of the various entities in play was very difficult for me. Perhaps 10-15 minutes dedicated to explaining just that would be helpful to students.

All in all, a fantastic course though!"
402,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the course from start to end!  Each course is well organized, the teacher taught really well, and the programming assignments are very rich with easy to follow guidance, and lots of good libraries / functions that we can leverage / learn from.  Thank you very much!  Have a wonderful day!  "
403,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Finally I finished the whole series of Deep Learning AI, through which I gained a lot of intuition of deep learning algorithms and its implementation. It's great course to get into this new era especially with a excellent teacher like Andrew who really illustrates the core ideas of deep learning algorithms to me."
404,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The last module is awesome as all previous ones. Thank you all guys! 
406,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thank you for this amazing, indepth, structured course that has explained and ensured the understanding with resourceful vedios by Andrew Ng  Sir,  and quizzes  that check our understanding  and organized assignments. Thank you for the team for this wonderful course. "
407,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course is well structured! Dr Andrew Ng teaches very well all the concepts in the videos and also references to the papers. Along with the programming exercises, we can put in practise all the concepts from the videos. The exercises are also very well documented."
408,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was by far the most challenging and most interesting course of all the courses in the specialization. Really gives your brains a hard time, but after you see/hear (haha) the results, it seems that all that was worth the effort!!! THANKS ANDREW, for everything!!!"
409,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Very good course as all run by Andrew Ng :)
411,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It was an unbelievable journey through this Deep Learning Specialization! I really felt the power of the tools I obtained during the past 3 weeks that it took me to pass all 5 courses of the specialization. Many of the Programming Assignments are demanding and in the end I could be extremely satisfied that I succeeded in taking them all. Thanks a lot to Andrew Ng and all involved for making this sequence of courses accessible to people like me, and presenting it in such an understandable and interesting way! Now, I can start thinking of the vast potential for using Deep Neural Networks not only in Research and Space Sciences, where my interests are, but also in my daily life. Very many thanks again! AJ"
412,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The whole series was excellent but in particular this last course on RNNs. Thank you for not skipping the mathematical details and letting us figure out backpropagations through time and how Adam works under the hood and explaining LSTMs and Attention so well. There was even a notebook on Attention! And the dinosaurus notebook was cool but the jazz improvisation really blew me away: the music actually sounded really nice! :) Also, thank you for pre-training the models to safe us time and teach us how to resume training from learned weights! The quizzes were helpful in developing an intuition and the price point was more than fair. Perfect series, Andrew, thanks a lot!"
413,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Another excellent course, well presented, with compelling content.  My only concerns are regarding the labs.   With no previous Python or Keras experience, I found I needed to spend a lot of time coming up to speed on new programming domains in order to complete the assignments (my previous experience is mainly C).   While this was somewhat an issue in the previous courses in the Specialization, I found it particularly so in Sequence Models.  This distracted from the main objective of understanding the core NN algorithms.   I would recommend either: 1) advising students to have a solid background in Python, or 2) a bit more clarity on how to use the Keras functions in the labs."
414,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Previously, I have taken online classes before in Machine Learning by going the cheap route (Udemy, blogs, youtube) and you get what you pay for. Andrew Ng explains it the most thorough, easiest, and simplest way possible.  Presentation material is very understandable. Great class for new machine learning learners. Highly recommend it. The only downside is that the programming exercises are little too easy in my opinion. I feel like the best way to get your hands dirty is to do actual projects (do your own projects). These lectures are good for intuition and background of different types of Neural Network architectures. Other than that, Great material. Thanks Andrew!"
415,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A very good course. It presented gated units like GRU and LSTM with so much simplicity that anyone can understand it on the first run. The downsides were the Jazz music generation, since it was the only task where the data is non intuitive (MIDI files) so you black-box apply the algorithm to a data you have no idea how it is structured, unless, of course, you are familiar with MIDI files prior to this course. Other than that, the learning curve was a bit slower in the beginning, but explodes by the end of the course, where you put all the subjects you've learned to perform a neural machine translation, which, in my opinion, was hugely awesome and rewarding."
416,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Like all other course in this specialization, this is also indeed a great course. It fundamentally clears concepts and gives very clear concpts for topics such as RNN and LSTM, which can ohterwise can be difficult to digest. Also, the programming excersices, built on great topics, suh as Music synthesis, Trigger word activation, are exciting to work on. The only feedback I would like to suggest, is that topics of Backpropogation for sequence model is critical and should have been taken up indepth in study rather than left to excerciss only. Overall this course is more fast paced and packed 3 weeks which should have been perhaps a 4 week course."
417,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course teaches in-depth knowledge of sequence models in natural language processing and speech regocnition . The programming excercises and the quizzes provide more content to furthur your grasp on the matter . The progamming exercises being totally in Keras , provides a clear analogy of how LSTM s and GRU s , work along with attention models introduced in the last week. You also have to implement  a LSTM and RNN from scratch in Numpy , which provides for the basic knowledge how these architectures actually work. Overall , it was a great experience and taking this course should be a pre-requisite for all learning in NLP. "
418,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Whew! This was very interesting and challenging. I have a huge backlog of things I need to go back and read up on and better understand. I really appreciate the work that Andrew and his team put into these courses.  The lectures were very well paced and clear. His temperament is exemplary for a teacher and his subject knowledge comes across.  I found the exercises really well thought out and beautifully crafted. The coding style could not have been more clear and the consistency made it understandable despite the complexity of the subject and the limited time to delve into the mechanics of Keras and the Python tools. Bravo!
419,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The last course is in this series does not disappoint. I found this course to be more difficult than the others; likely because I had very little prior exposure to recurrent neural networks. However, this course is worth the effort as it opens up a realm of new possibilities; text, audio & time-series data. Whether you need to detect, classify or translate sequences, or even generate new sequences in the vein of some examples, this course is for you. There are several high-level APIs for performing these tasks but having a deeper understanding of what these APIs are doing is invaluable to your success. Take this course."
420,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"An extremely well thought off and comprehensive introduction to sequence models, with examples taken from the most important/interesting application domains. Andrew NG's clarity of exposition is absolutely wonderful on such an otherwise complex area. The assignments are very cleverly chosen and helped me to finally get to grips with Keras. This being a new course, the assignment notebooks had a few minor issues that are well known by now and documented in forums and erratas, and will likely be fixed in subsequent reruns. Nevertheless, given the breadth and quality of the content, 5 starts are absolutely well deserved."
421,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was, in my opinion, the best of the 5 courses. Actually, here's how I'd rank the courses (from best to worse): "
422,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course, undoubtedly, has the toughest assignments compared to all the previous courses. The content is rich and informative. Again, pay close attention to the hints given in the programming exercises. If you don't follow, check the Discussion Forums to get a hint. Professor Andrew, your teaching is absolutely sublime - Crisp and concise. Personally, I would have loved an entire week dedicated to Attention Models as the entire concept seemed a bit rushed. Other than that, I have absolutely no qualms! For the people who are enrolling for THIS course only - make sure you're pretty good with Python and Keras."
423,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Such a great course. It explains everything from scratch and teach you how to code in numpy (scratch) and how to code in keras to build high performance system (instead of tiny datasets).
424,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This a the last and the most anticipated course for me. It's hard, informative and most useful. I've got chance to learn some popular and powerful methods within the years, like word embedding and attention mechanism. I start to understand the way deep learning community deal with NLP, i.e., ingenious design of network structure inspired by the pattern human beings perceive the world. It doesn't enjoy solid foundation as statistical learning does, but is works and suitable for engineering. That's astonishing! I hope I can combine deep learning with traditional methods to better understand NLP."
425,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I just want to say Thanks to Andrew and the team for a great content. I may not be able to create award winning NLP models after this course, but I have learned a bunch about them. Lots of work went into creating great videos and even more in creating the programming projects. I really appreciate the format of the programming assignments. For someone with not much experience in DL, they were pretty close to perfect: I felt I was not left to fend for myself, yet they were not overly simple and forced me to solidify what was thought in the lectures and learn better. Thank You Andrew and team!"
426,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I have been through wonderful journey of learning and implementing deep learning from very scratch. This course really transforms one from caterpillar to butterfly with very minimal pain of calculus and linear algebra. Thanks to Andrew and deeplearning.ai team for providing such a marvelous bundles of knowledge. 
427,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Lots and Lots of knowledge and experience in 3-weeks of class. In Machine Learning terms, this course maximizes the knowledge and experience gained with sequence models by minimizing the time required to complete the course. Lecture videos are very intuitive while assignment projects are very real-world centric."
428,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"As always one of the best courses offer by coursera and it was a hell of a ride. I learned about many things like RNN,sequence model,GRU,LSTM,word triggered,word sampling,translation using deep learning algorithm . Andrew did a fantastic job and keep everything simple so that everything can be understandable."
429,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Really good choice of topics, including state of the art tools like attention and word embeddings. Very useful, especially for those interested in Language Processing applications. However, the videos and assignments need some more careful editing, because there are occasional mistakes, lazy explanations etc."
430,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very great and aspiring course, I learned lots of concepts in this course. I think It would be better If there was a capstone project for the final course of deep learning specialization. It was very great but If I had the opportunity of implementing a project from zero to 100, It would be more than great... "
431,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course, though not as awesome as other Ng's courses. I think creators became a bit tired closer to the last course in specialization. Anyway, fantastic courses, fantastic specialization, fantastic professor! Thank you very much!! Looking forward to new courses - maybe Reinforcement Learning, GANs? =)"
432,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Leave it up to Mr. Andrew Ng to explain complex concepts in a very much intuitive manner. The guy is a world apart when it comes to explaining complex concepts. No other MOOC even comes close. Absolutely highly recommended.
433,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course by Prof Ng. I had taken his Machine Learning course a 
few years ago, so expected high standards of content and assignment 
preparation - I was not disappointed. Staff is very responsive and 
helpful in forums as well. I highly recommend it. Taken as part of the 
DeepLearning specialization."
434,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I loved this course as wel, I had a little bit less time to advance as steadily as I did with previous courses. So I had a little bit of trouble getting the context back when starting again each time. The next steps for me are putting what I learned into practice and basing myself on what I learned here."
435,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course offers a great introduction to the models: RNN, GRU and LSTM."
436,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Andrew Ng introduced lots of state-of-the-art sequence models in this course. These models are quite useful and powerful in sequential modeling scenarios, e.g., natural language processing, time series prediction. The programming exercises are very helpful to enhance the understanding of these models."
437,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course content is very good. This course seemed a little bit harder than other previous courses. There is lots of improvement opportunities for Coursera's Lab (Jypeter notebooks), every now and then it does not work i.e. cant submit the assignment, it's very very slow, its just not up to the mark."
438,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,A very well organized introduction to the wonderland of Recurrent Neural Networks. The course takes the student through multiple use cases of various RNN architectures with practical advice on how and where to use them.  The awesome programming assignments with excellent documentation is a highlight! 
439,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"With this course it's possible to conclude that recurrent neural networks are the most powerful variant of neural networks. Used in a many places, this course expleains ingishtfully how they work, what's the math behind them, and how different implementations function for different areas of research."
440,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Andrew Ng knows how to make people understand the problem, architect a solution and then map it to data. He does it very well. I am going to repeat his course again as I still believe there is something that I have missed and I need to follow him thoroughly. I want to understand and process like him."
441,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"overall it is another great course, clear explain on the RNN, LSTM, GRU, etc. really like the assignment to implement RNN from scratch. assignments related to Keras needs ""googling"" outside resources, and there is still some keras homework to be done in order to fully understand the assignment code. "
442,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thank you very much instructors. I learnt both fundamentals of deep learning and application of them in simple and efficient way. I have been long and fruitful journey with Andrew Ng. I learnt sound mathematics required for deep learning, tensorflow software, applications of sequence and RNN models."
443,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"An excellent course in every way. The presentation of the material, a charismatic lecturer, interesting tasks - everything was just perfect. Thank you so much for the opportunity to take this excellent course, I am eternally grateful to you and I want to take all the courses that you have released!"
444,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,非常感谢老师提供的课程，原本课程实验对LSTM有相关研究需求，该课程很关键的提供了相关知识点的教学，再次感谢老师和平台！
445,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A very good course to learn the fundamentals of Sequence models. It contain a lot of important developments of the sequence models and together with the programming assignments, it makes easier to learn. I found this course very easy to follow and understand the theories. I highly recommend this."
446,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I have always found difficult how RNN and LSTM works as theretically I was not getting a clear picture how it was working .The programming assignments helped clear my doubts and I got a clear understanding to a lot of extent how this mechanism is working and how it is useful in speech synthesis.
447,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course introduces the basic idea of RNN, GRU and LSTM models. They are obviously harder than the CNN models and the concepts are not so easy to understand. Thanks to the systematic introduction! Together wit the excises I can understand better the theory from the applications. It's great!"
448,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The content, examples, assignments, and quizzes are thoroughly developed. All the courses of the specialization share the same notation and lead a student from basic concepts to complex ones helping to develop an intuition on each step. The best course on topic of Deep Learning one could find."
449,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,It was a great experience to learn from Andrew NG and it helped a lot to me personally and professionally. I have gained so much confidence after completing these set of 5 courses and looking forward to build some cool projects on my own using the concepts that i have learned in past 5 months. 
450,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A great course on latest technology used in NLP. The course is well structured and provides an in-depth knowledge on sequence models. This course is a all-in-one package for starting your career in NLP. Mr. Andrew is a great teacher, and explains everything in a very simple yet effective way."
451,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great finish to the specialisation. I have learned a lot of the core details of how to proceed with my own Deep Learning projects. My one piece of feedback would be for an intermediary step, that requires more of the programming myself, as a lot of the intricate coding has already been done."
452,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great selection of topics, clear explanations from Dr. Ng, and coding exercises to allow the understanding of the topics. Perhaps I would have liked to see some Time series analysis in the Sequential Networks parts, but even though, it was a great course.
Thank you Dr. Ng and all your team!"
453,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The course content is very good but the mistakes in the videos are being mentioned after the video. This is making us get confused a bit. It would be good if those errors are mentioned before the video itself so that we can look into that before watching the video and get prepared for that. 
454,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Excellent teaching, materials, and organization! It's great to include state-of-the-art technologies like Transformer and LSTM. I would recommend also teaching some practical skills (like TensorFlow) that students can apply directly in practical programming (beyond the course assignments)."
455,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great appreciation to Dr. Andrew Ng. The course has been incredibly well taught. Thank you so much for your enlightening lectures. I very much enjoyed the course, and I think it is very well structured and organized. The forum was very helpful when I got stuck in the programming exercises. "
456,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It is a great course, and the same applies to the whole Deep Learning Specialisation. It is  very nice to see that many people all around the world can relatively easily get access to these learning materials as well as to the problem exercises. Thank you for making it widely available !"
457,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I am amazed with the learning experience of Seq2Seq Modules created by deeplearning.ai team! Loved the way it's taught by Andrew Ng and the hands on experience helped the mentee very well. Keep building such courses, would like to contribute more in this space as in research or products."
458,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Insightful detail on model architectures and how they influence (and are influenced by) data generation for sequence-based applications. For those that have grasped the theory behind DNNs and are interested in applying ML to language and text, I highly recommend checking out this course!"
459,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course, well explained. Sometimes the course material gets a bit too general but this is done when the details would be unbearable to cover. The overview of all the machine learning conepts is an amazing start for purusing anything deep learning related in my novice point of view."
460,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I like the course. It's beneficial and clear. Also, the concept is clear. "
461,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course was really awsome,learning has been fun in all the 4 courses, the number of new things learnt in this course was remarkable.Even the mot complicated things were taught in such a way that it never seemed tough.Doing assignments really helped to make concepts even more clear."
462,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Fantastic course! Presents both the theory and practical uses in a straightforward manner that is easy to grasp. Programming assignments are a mix of NumPy and Keras API, with the former being more illustrative of the inner workings of RNNs and the latter being more practically useful."
462,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course! It teaches the necessary to implement deep neural networks problems and give you practical advice. You can go deeper as you want in the material of this course, the programming assignments can be extended by going into the optional content. "
463,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Excellent! Amazing! Such good quality of lecture and assignments. Thank you Andrew and team for giving me such a good overview of what i can use this for. I feel as though this series dramatically lowered the barriers to entry for me to get started on any ML project i decide to. Thanks
464,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,No better introductory material. I suggest doing NLP specialization by deeplearning.ai after this though I have still not tried it out myself yet but hoping to do it some time. Thank you Andrew! I got emotional in your last video of the course. You are such an example for educators <3
465,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This was by far the Best Course and Specialization that I have done. Thank You Coursera and Thank You Sir Andrew NG . You have made me confident and able in the Field of Deep Learning. I am grateful to you Sir. I will try my best to use this knowledge as a superpower in the right way.
466,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,1) Course over all is good.
467,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,So much gray area about sequence model was covered here! Broad topics covered with practical exercises make this course a must-have when dealing with sequence-related problems in deeplearning.
468,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thanks to DeepLearning.AI, I now have good grasp of Sequence Models and their techniques. I really hope that DeepLearning.AI team will create more amazing and helpful courses like this in the future. Best wishes to all of the members of DeepLearning.AI!"
469,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A very enjoyable course.Every concept is explained is very intuitive way by Andrew Ng.Thanks to all the organizers for such a wonderful course.All new concepts are also discussed.Anyone who wants to learn about AI ,should definitely opt for this course."
470,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course is Very structured, concise and organised. I really enjoyed this course especially the Attention Mechanism in the Neural Machine Translation. Also the the trigger word assignment was both enjoyable and insightful. Thank you so much Andrew Ng"
471,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I was happy to learn about the Speech processing and more importantly when the system recognizes the ""Activate"" word. The way professor Andrew explains difficult topics is really appreciable. Thanks a ton for making the complex subject so easy to learn."
472,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"In my opinion, this module was a little more complex than the previous ones, however, it has been an excellent course to deepen my knowledge in recurrent neural networks and close this specialization program in deep learning. Thank you very much, Dr. Andrew Ng and deeplearningai!!!!"
473,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course with interesting exercises. One can really see the amount of effort  being put into creating the assignment material, so they are at a suitable level and with a lot to take away, and the students have a good understanding of details through practice. Really appreciated."
474,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I don't know how to express my feeling of gratitude. The DeepLearning Specialisation to some degreee, changes my life, including career and reserach. I will definitely make fully use of this superpower to improve humanity and the whole community! Thank you again to deeplearning.ai!"
475,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,the programing assignment ins WEEK 1 was a bit ambiguous in nature. helped me improve my debugging skills. 
476,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,More easier to understand than the ConvNets course!
477,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is a great course. It provides a good introduction to RNNs and how they are used in sequence modeling. Introduction to GRU, LSTMs, BiRNNs, attention model is great way to learn these in depth. The exercises are designed to make you familiar with the internals of these layers."
478,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Having done the previous courses or not, this course will teach a whole lot about the past, present and future of NLP. At the end, as Prof. Andrew Ng has said, one can feel proud about how easily a topic can be explained with the help of just one slide. "
479,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course teaches the fundamentals of NLP, traditional and modern approaches to solving NLP problems. It starts with the basics and go pretty advance. I highly recommend this course especially if you want to significantly improve your knowledge in AI. "
480,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was the last course of specialization and it was a great journey. Thank you Sir Andrew NG for making such a wonderful course. Thank you coursera for giving us a great platform. Talking about course, it was a great course to learn NLP from scratch."
481,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Excellent course to get the nuts and bolts of sequence models and natural language processing using deep learning.As always instructors have been absolutely brilliant.Really really enjoyed the course.The course offers excellent programming assignments.
482,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Such an amazing course. Andrew is such a great instructor. Actually, 
it is thanks to the whole Specialization that I'm making
 now my own career as Chief AI Scientist for a Health Tech Start Up."
483,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The best introduction to NLP and RNNs. Andrew Ng is simply remarkable and the assignments were interesting too. Highly recommend it for others. Felt a tad nostalgic as this was the final course of the specialization - Andrew Ng has that effect on you. 
484,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It was a great experience!! I have completed my entire module of Deep Learning. I am now good to go with Deep Learning. Wish me luck!! Thanks a lot, Andrew Ng and team for creating this beautiful journey!! I hope you spread this knowledge everywhere. "
485,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course, as always, de-mystifies a quite complicated topic and gives very good intuition why the models work. For example, LSTM is very complicated unit but Andrew illustrates well what it tries to achieve. That said, this is a very tough course."
486,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I can't thank Andrew Sir and Coursera enough for enabling me with this wealth of knowledge in NLP. With this I can dive deeper into NLP and look at a career change as well into this area. The course has immensly boosted not only my knowledge but also my confidence. Much obliged.
487,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"At the beginning this is very counter-intuitive. But later on when I am on the final assignment, I finally realized that we are not focusing on gradient descent, but architecture building and training set assembling!  When everything start to make sense, it is really intriguing."
488,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course made me have great understanding around the Sequence Models such as GRU, LSTM, Attention, etc. I had a lot of fun while completing programming exercises such as Trigger word detection. As always, it was one of the best class ever. Thanks Professor Andrew Ng and all-!"
490,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This course is one of the best course we can take for deep learning.The quiz assignment was good.The programming assignment was easy to understand many functions which i find it difficult in videos.Overall the instructor Andrew Ng lecture was good
491,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This course covers a lot of ground and provides many opportunities to practice the concepts.  I just wish there were one or two (possibly optional/honors ) assignments with fewer walk through instructions so one could test one's learning for real.
492,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was very cool, RNNs seem very powerful. I don't think the programming exercises were the best to get some experience but I really like the way Andrew explains the algorithms. Still 5*"
493,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course is a nice introduction to neural networks applied to sequence models. It has interesting applications in natural language processing and speech recognition. It would have been nice to apply the concepts to time series prediction, too. "
494,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is a pretty cool course to work on introduction of NLP. A blend of practical and theoritical aspects included though there are black boxes (I felt Convolutional Course to be more effective though, maybe because of my background, but still!!)"
495,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I don't know why this course has not been rated more than the other courses of this specialization.  In my opinion,  this is the best course among all the others. All thanks to Andrew Sir and Coursera team to introduce me to this specialization. "
496,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The course is very helpful in learning the important concepts of RNN in a very easy way.  The instructor has a very unique style of teaching which makes the typical concepts easy and at the same the makes you develop your interest in the course.
497,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Andrew Ng and the team have created a fantastic opportunity to learn the basics of Deep Learning Algorithms. ""Hearing from Lion's mouth"" was a great experience for me. I would strongly recommend any deep learning enthusiast to attend the course."
498,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. It's a good course to make you understand about major knowledge to process sequence by DL, and the assignments are the hidden gems."
499,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course teaching state-of-the art NLP technologies. I wish the attention notebook could be improved, and the projects could get more flexible and in-depth. I also wish there could be a Keras tutorial that gives an overview of the framework."
500,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Andrew Ng is a fantastic instructor. His ability  to break down  a complicated concept like neural networks and deep learning so that a non-math, non computer person  like me actually understands the underlying mechanisms is quite extraordinary."
501,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very effective mix of theory and practical examples, cemented by practice exercises in form of the programming assignments.  The guided instructions of the programming assignments are as valuable as the lectures.  I would recommend putting the ""errata"" readings *before* the videos containing the errors (as was done in an earlier course).  I also notice that some quiz questions pick up on nuances that were quite underplayed in the lectures, but going back over my notes, did find them."
502,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Smooth and hands-on walkthrough of basics of NLP and speech recognition. The flow of the course is very well-designed.
503,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Amazing course overall. Prof Ng's diagrams are the clearest explanations of DL models I have found anywhere and it's that clear a ton of thought went into planning the notations. The assignments are exciting and surprisingly fun. One could say that there is a little too much handholding throughout the assignments, but I understand that this course is more about the heuristics. Again, it's fantastic course overall and the resources provided throughout are truly unique to Coursera! "
504,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was my first AI course and I really made significant progress in my understanding of foundations of deep learning with this. Thanks to Professor Andrew's very informative course videos, grasping the complex concepts became possible. The quizzes and the assignments were challenging, made possible for me to use logic and develop new coding skills to go at it. I would recommend this course to everyone interested in AI/ML. Thanks to Professor Andrew for making this course."
505,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is an amazing course, it Provides a great Help...i have learned lots n lots of stuff  about NLP, Learn about recurrent neural networks that work extremely well on temporal data, word vector representations and embedding layers --that are explained in a concise manner, and more importantly I love the Attention mechanism, the  model that understand where it should focus...... its attention given a sequence of inputs.... amazing amazing ..highly Recommended.... Thankyou  "
506,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course was a great introduction to the world of RNNs. Starting from basic sequence models all the way through RNNs constructed with Convolutional layers, LTSM layers, GRU layers and wrapping up with the Attention Algorithm. It is great base work to start a Deep Learning career.  The course is very well structured and the resources in the forums were always life-saving. Very grateful for this course and I am waiting for the Advanced Specialization from Deeplearning.ai "
507,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Really good course for RNNs with NLP. Recommended to anyone who has completed the first four courses of the specialization. A thing to notice is that the last programming assignment is really hard to save and submit to your servers though it was pretty well organized.
508,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I really liked the whole Specialization, it is great: clear and interesting!"
509,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Another Excellent Course from Professor Andrew Ng. The detail in the explanations are excellent, and the provided exercises using Jupyter are super fun to complete and put to the test your knowledge offering you at the same time a library of ideas and models to use in your future projects. I enjoyed this last course in the specialization quite a lot, thanks very much to Andrew Ng and the Staff from Coursera. I hope to see more courses like this in the future.
"
510,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I love this course. Maybe about 1 and half year I was trying to learn DL. I thought about giving up because I wasn't able to learn, so, in May of this year 2020, Coursera opened its courses to undergraduates. I do not thought twice, at the same hour that I knew that news about free courses, I began this. Then, after that time I want to thank to Professor Ng and all colaborators on that site. One day I will be one of student of Professor Andrew Ng in Stanford. "
511,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A greatly knowledgeable course! I learned a lot about Natural Language Processing and explored RNNs, LSTMs, Word Embeddings, Seq2Seq Models, Attention Mechanism, etc. The course focuses more on the concepts along with providing the essential math. It was fun to implement Language Models, Neural Machine Translation & Speech Recognition. I would surely recommend this course to the ones who are diving into the world of NLP, and need a perfect introduction to it."
512,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A very systematic and well structured specialization course on deep learning by Andrew and team. The concepts are explained with a focus on intutiveness. The assignments and quizes help in understaind the concepts better and realising them with programming. Coming from zero backgrond of Deep learning to now being confident of using the concepts in my fututure research work, i would like to thank coursera and team Andrew for such a wonderful specialization."
513,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Another very good course, though not without its failings. Mainly, the Transformers' lectures and programming assignment were confusing and didn't go into enough depth to deliver the intuition."
514,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This end course is a little more  complicated than the previous ones, especially in programming homework. However,  it also inherits the merits of the special, gives learners the basic framework of sequence models. What impresses me most is the lesson of ""Debiasing word embeddings"", it shows that AI could be designed to do more against human stale thoughts, which sets up a  good principle for designing AI. Yes, it should be taught to new learners of AI."
515,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I d recommend this course to those who want to find their your paths as they are searching for what it is that makes their life fullfilling. The series of Depp learning specialization made me acquaitned many important technical, some fundumental and some advanced, aspects of AI world and standing here, now, I suppose I can think better about what I'm gonna do in the future."
516,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Finally... Every piece of effort was worth it! After so many hours, now I understand how proud we can fell of completing these amazing courses! The best one I have tried so far, definitely made a difference in my professional views but above all, it confirmed my expectations: this is the activity sector where I want to develop, the work in which I want to grow without any doubt."
517,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This regards all 5 courses of the DL specialisation.
518,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This was the most difficult and most interesting course i had in all of the five deeplearning.ai courses
519,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Will give this course also 5 stars. The assignments were easy but required some knowledge of Keras.  So you have to invest some time on their site.Otherwise it's like fitting  pieces in a bigger puzzle. Most pieces are already layed out for you .. you need to just fit your small ones. 
520,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Course contents and coverage was best. Duration of 3 weeks is little too short to really understand all the details of programming exercises.  May be extend this to 4 to 5 weeks and spend little more time on speech recognition, music generation and other audio data processing would have helped."
521,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"  Wonderful course, expert instruction from Prof. Ng.  I can't recommend the Specialization enough.   "
522,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"RNN, LSTM, GRU... fun stuff even you don't focus on NLP.  As always, Andrew makes complicated things simpler.  I certainly will keep all the course materials for future reference. "
523,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Sequence Models are a though subject. many people, during working meeting, mention them as the final resource and solution to everything.  I feel I better understand the nuances of them thanks to this course."
524,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I go back and forth on whether the time-saving aspects of the Python Notebooks are worth the reduction in ML coding experience. I suppose these aren't coding classes, but I also feel some of the concepts aren't cemented as well as if the students were led through a more challenging, trial-and-error experience. That's hard to do, though."
525,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Immensely grateful for holding this course, specially Prof. Ng. The way he explained the all concept to the mathematical models was very endearing and excellent."
526,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"You SAVED MY LIFE Thank you soooooooooo much!!, I am ready to give every thing I have just to thank you!!!!!!!!!!!! GOD BLESS YOU SOOOOO much ... keep contributing this world need people like you."
527,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The best course I've ever taken on Deep Learning. Full of content explain easily and intuitively.  Thank to this course I learn most of the things I did not study in the normal university course. 
528,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Another absolutely unbelievable course by Andrew Ng! Phenomenal content, great delivery, engaging programming exercises and awesome real-world applications. Couldn't be happier about taking this."
529,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I am very grateful to Andrew for not only explaining how it works, but also why so. This is the hardest of the five deeplearning.ai courses, but it is a great pleasure to understand LSTM and GRU."
530,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,great and very helpful. i think the 5th course is a little bit difficult than the previous 4 courses and take need some basic knowledge about keras. but you can also learn a lot with this course.
531,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Now I know what those famous LSTM are all about! Great introduction to recurrent neural networks, absolute requirement for NLP, speech recognition, sentence generation and many more applications."
532,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,A really great course that takes you through the inner working of most deep learning models. I really enjoyed the course and I am looking forward to learning more from the deeplearning.ai team.
533,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This whole course was an incredible learning experience on topics that I had no major references, this allowed me to open my mind to a totally unknown world full of opportunities and challenges."
534,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Really, what you have done throughout this specialization is truly magical! Taking this course was the best thing that could have happened in my life as a learner! Thank you, Andrew NG and team!"
535,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Excellent course on Machine Learning Entry & Advancement. I've gained so much intuition with depth so much. I'm sure this course is gonna be the fundamental stone on my machine learning career!
536,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"taught in an exceptional way, foundations were explained in step by step manner. Will recommend  those want to learn latest techniques in voice detection, trigger response and voice assistance."
537,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Andrew Ng's amazing teaching is the only reason I took this course and I am not disappointed at all. Well structured course with great programming exercises relevant to real world applications.
538,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The course is really effective both on theoretical and the practical part. All the main topic for sequence models have been presented in an intriguing and clear manner. Congratulations to all.
539,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great introduction to practical Keras-based deep learning algorithms, studies, techniques and delivered using Jupyter notebooks. Couldn't ask for a better approach to teaching machine learning"
540,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Great course for learning about how to deal with sequential data. I really enjoyed it. You can read the keras documentation for the programming exercises in case you are not familiar with it.
541,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Just finished the entire course. I learned a lot. I do believe that they give you too much clues during the exercises, but since I've never used python before, I don't really mind. Thank you!"
542,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Best Course I have ever completed. The lectures were very engaging and would give you through insight of the problems. Various ideas and their application was depicted in very beautiful ways.
543,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course! As usual, very clear and detailed explanation, break down tough concepts into simpler terms. I've learnt a lot from the course. Thank you so much, Prof. Andrew Ng and your team!"
544,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Very thankful to Professor Andrew and course instructors and  mentors.
545,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Once again great quality material delivered by Mr. Ng. Dives quite deep with hands-on practice and provides additional pointers for people who want to go on to an even deeper understanding.
546,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Amazing course, just like the previous 4 of the specialization. Sir Andrew Ng has simplified and helped implement deep learning in a really helpful way. Grateful to have such a great teacher"
547,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This course was my favourite and definitely the most challenging.  Every course with Andrew Ng is amazing.  Thank you and I will continue to take more courses in this area of specialization.
548,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The sequence model course is good , but compared to the convolutional neural net course it somewhat lacking in the content. But overall the concepts and assignments are good and challenging."
549,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"All the contents are very nice and understandable. Quiz ,Lab and Assignments are useful for understand the implementations and development. Thank you Andrew sir for this wonderful contents.  "
550,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course. Very challengint for me, but thanks to the clear explanations provided i could finish it and have surprises when I found that many of my thinking on the matter was right!"
551,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,In my opinion this 5th course on sequence model is the most interesting (and the hardest) course in this specialization; not only the content but the programming practices are well built.
552,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thanks for taking the time to put this together!  It was very helpful, and I've gone from total ML newbie to confidently creating my own useful models and applications.  I recommend this course on a regular basis."
553,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,A Brilliant Course!!! I got to learn a lot very efficiently about Recurrent Neural Networks!!! Thank you so much deeplearning.ai!!!
554,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great Course, just like the rest in the specialisation! Really like the method of teaching!! Some sections of the assignment were coded before hand but would have been nice to be able to code them as well. Thanks"
555,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is how a course needs to design, hats off guys a proper mathematical explanation for intuition. Andrew ng he has special quality how to draw students if topics are too hard that's what a good teacher needs.  "
556,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Dr. Andrew is the best instructor! The course not just covers the conceptual understanding but also connects you to everything that has happened/ is happening in the particular field, and the ""Heroes"" of course! "
557,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Overall the course was quite satisfactory and exhaustive learning. The explanation of professor Andrew Ng was very simple and understandable. I loved learning the course and completed it way before the due date.  
558,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Excellent course both in terms of content and the tools provided! Of course, you've got to put the effort to understand what's going on and pull together the bigger picture, especially in the weekly assignments. "
559,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This is an excellent course. The lecturers are clear and informative. The programming projects are well designed to teach learners basic concepts without drowning in too much details. Thanks for the great work. 
560,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is just the beginning. you will have a flashlight, a rope, and some other necessary stuff. you might need to build necessary stuff and keep hiking. Enjoy learning basics of hiking from best hiker (prof NG)"
561,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Everything from the basic concepts such as GRUs and LSTMs to audio and language applications explained perfectly and simply in such a way that even a high school student like me could understand it. Thank you!
562,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This is is a very good cutting edge course. I would like to have less ' help' in the programming assignments or replicate the CNN course by implementing research paper algorithms. ALL in ALL great great course
563,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This series is a gem. Although, I have build some Deep Learning Models, this course provided me an in-depth knowledge of 'What, How and Why'. It enhanced my theoretical underpinnings of learning astoundingly. "
564,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"this course is an excellent introduction in Sequence models and RNN, it helped me a lot as all the course in the specialisation."
565,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I loved the graded coding exercises. Took forever for a noob like me to understand few points, but I eventually did. And it made all the difference. Thank you for creating such a well drafted course ! Cheers"
566,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"After several months of completing this specialization, I will still come back to refresh and further strengthen my understanding via Andrew's excellent explanation on the topics. Thanks Andrew and his team!"
567,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The programming assignments are well designed and very practical. Finishing them is the best way to learn the techniques. This is the best class and recommend it to anyone who wants to learn sequence models. 
568,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Hard sometimes for someone how is not familiar with Python to understand how an object is the class is called. I would be nice if there were some examples, what it means and how it works to call an object. "
569,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Great course. Although it is a little hard to grasp what RNN is doing from the beginning. It would be helpful if there's a simple demonstration what each step of RNN is doing at the beginning of the course.
570,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Amazing course. Amazing explanation of how Sequence Models work in a very intuitive and practical way. Amazing code examples - learnt a lot. Oh just one note though -- Durian is from Malaysia not Singapore!
571,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I have to admit that this, together with the 4th course, was the most difficult one. However, I definitely learnt a lot from this course. Thank you very much to Prof. Andrew Ng and his assistant professors."

2549,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Note: this review also applies to the specialization as a whole. I thoroughly enjoyed the courses and learnt so much. The content delivery was excellent. I am not sure how unfeasible it was to re-produce the videos, though it would have been nice to see fewer corrections. In regards to the programming assignments, I think that they are great overall. The way the code was mostly pre-filled to ensure logical workflow helped me to stay on track rather than trying to skip straight to the final model (I assume beginner programmers do this a lot). It provided a great template for thought and I will definitely be referring back regularly. However, I also think that descriptions and exercises could be integrated better, especially in the later assignments where students are compiling more complex models and prior skills in programming (from earlier courses) are expected. Specifically, there are certain Exercise descriptions with multiple parts 1a,b,c 2a,b,c etc and hints before you even get to the start of the actual implementation. I think this is inefficient and was a bit frustrating at times. It felt a bit disjointed and overwhelming to read the instructions without no context (i.e. reading about step 2c before implementing step 1a). On the whole, I know that the knowledge, understanding and skills I obtained through this specialization will serve me extremely well throughout my PhD. Thank you very much."
2550,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I enjoyed Prof Ng's excellent lectures, but felt the material moved too quickly.  This 3-week course could easily have been extended to (say) 5 weeks to allow for more depth in covering the various RNNs, applications and model details. "
2551,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"While I loved listening to Andrew Ng's lectures and I find him very lucid in his presentation and pedagogy, I feel that the practical aspect has suffered -by giving enough hints on how to solve the programming exercises, the challenge is reduced. There were quite a few issues I also faced when connecting to the server which resulted in rewriting the code a couple of times (in hindsight, I should have always made a local copy and tested it before submitting it). I would rather that each of these courses becomes a 2 month course (much like Stanfords convolutional networks course) so that the practical aspect is also given equal weightage. While presenting the lectures, Prof Andrew Ng could also lay it out how you would implement in a particular framework like tensorflow and there should be enough exercises that walk a person through them before attempting the programming exercises."
2552,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course has great material on sequence models, presented with the usual energy and enthusiasm that Andrew Ng brings to every course.  The model diagrams are great for visualizing what's actually going on in the complex assignments, and the assignments are generally designed with 1) additional code and commentary to make the examples informative and 2) the ""guard rails"" (e.g., insert code here, with related hints)  to clarify the specific lines to edit.  Having said that, I feel that the assignments were a little less polished/refined relative to earlier courses in the concentration, and I spent significantly more time in the discussion forums than I had in prior courses.  I also recommend investing in additional training in Keras and Tensor Flow as a prerequisite or in parallel to this course to help get the most out of the practical applications of the material."
2553,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As i progressed through the specialization i liked the content less for the following 3 reasons. 1) With the exception of the first course there are no in-video questions which would help learn/exercise on the spot. There could easily have been one question per 3-4 minutes of video content. 2) The programming exercises although useful, became more disconnected from the lectures as the specialization progressed- ie they focused on keras documentation which could have been accompanied by a lecture video dedicated to that goal (as in the second course with tensor flow). The result was that I just tried to get through the programming exercises in courses 4 and especially 5 without understanding much of what I was doing. 3) There were too many errors in the lecture. Overall a good specialization but at least points 1 and 2 should be fixed  "
2554,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,this was a really interesting course.  Too bad the details of the math are not really there.
2555,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It is a good course and a very important one. However, I needed to mark it a bit lower than most other courses in this specialization because I felt sometimes confused with Keras. Navigating in such higher level of abstraction would require a stronger support for the Keras part. I believe we could have explored a bit further the sequence models and yet I was sometimes struggling understanding some basic Keras instructions. Perhaps it could be included an extra programming assignment tutorial (for Keras) or extend the existing Keras tutorial. "
2556,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,First of all I would like to convey my thanks to Andrew Sir for not only this course but for the whole specialization.You are fantastic teacher and I will try to pay you back by solving real world problems with the help of knowledge you have imparted.
2557,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"nice course as always! I need really thanks Andrew and team for this, it is very well structured & informative, provide good intuition and solid base for future self-learning of this area. "
2558,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall, I liked the Machine Learning Stanford class' programing assignments better than the one in the deep learning specialization. For me, coming up with a full implementation of a function (and then having it unit tested by the grader), is more conducive of learning and more entertaining than a step by step, line by line guidance, as we get in the Jupiter notebooks. That said the notebook themselves are incredibly well designed and put together. I love how Andrew Ng, beyond his stature, unmatched knowledge, and outstanding teaching skills, puts his whole heart to work. That makes the world of a difference to me and helps me do the same with others. Thank you for everything!"
2559,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This was a VERY thorough overview of the machine learning architectures required to tackle a wide range of natural language processing problems. It's quite dense and I had to watch each lecture several times and break it down into chunks to avoid getting lost, but now that I'm finished there I feel like a lot of technology has been demystified. The assignments really hold your hand and mostly just test your ability to follow instructions with even a hazy understanding of the weekly concepts, so you shouldn't expect to graduate and then immediately build a machine translation system from the ground up, but I do feel very ready to dive into technical interviews."
2560,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This was a good course mainly on Recurrent Neaural Networks, including LSTMs, and Encoder/Decoder networks, and the Attention model. In the last week there a brief overview of the Transformer networks and a long exercise fleshing that out. This is an interesting combination of merging Recurrent Network and a convolution style network."
2561,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Review of the 5 courses: 
2562,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"A very helpful and enlightening course, though it felt a bit ""hand-wavy"" at times. It never really felt like we were getting the full story, like I was missing something the whole time. Word embeddings cleared up a lot, but the entire course was a lot of information to digest at once. Coming from an image processing background, most of the terminology was unfamiliar, and the programming assignments weren't quite as guided as previous ones."
2563,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I'm a fan of Andrew Ng's machine learning classes on Coursera. This was my least favorite. I'm not sure if it's because of the complexity of the material or that so much material is presented in a short time, but I feel that I'm not as confident about my knowledge of the material in this course compared to the earlier courses. In the last few assignments, I felt like I was mechanically plugging stuff in without really understanding the thought process. His teaching style seems much the same as the other courses though, so it's possible this could be due to me rather than the course."
2564,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I am grateful for the opportunity to have learned from an exceptional instructor, and one of the luminaries, in artificial intelligence. Insofar as this particular course is concerned, theory was well explained, as always. I feel like there was a bit of a disconnect in the implementations, though. Some of this was just the sheer challenge of using a still-unfamiliar platform (Keras). And, in concert with this latter point, some was due to a sort of ""fill in the blank"" approach to using the platform. Nonetheless, that I have learned, and learned a lot, is undeniable!"
2565,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"a more intuitive materials been used while teaching would be helpful to more effieciently and enjoyably grasp the concepts. what i mean is that the description or the summary the lessons been taught in a week are in the corresponding week's assignments; those summarys were more clear and visually pleasing than the inclass presentation. for example, usage of pens for drawing networks and the likes can be migrated to better animations ,etc. the crux is that the content in the course is great, but it feels like there is a good scope for improvement in presentation."
2566,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Firstly, thank to the course instructors and Dr.Ng for teaching us deep learning. You are all a gem. I enjoyed this course, and how simple it made coding RNNs. However, I believe the concepts could be simplified some more, even in the form of a pseudocode or conceptual outline. This is my 3rd course from Andrew Ng, so I know he's skilled at distilling deep learning concepts with ease. Week 1 was the best for me as the operation of the LSTM, GRU RNNs were succinctly outlined and set a solid foundation , Week 2 could be presented a less abstract way though. "
2567,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I think with sequence models, the course details were very challenging. I strongly believe that do take a course in Deeplearning Specialization, one must at least learn Python from basics to advanced level. However, Andrew Ng has made it easy for a first time student with programming background to understand most of the concepts in this specialization. Thank you Deeplearning.ai for this course. I have learned some of the cutting-edge skills that can't be easily found anywhere. I have learned a skill that will set me apart from the crowd."
2568,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I really enjoyed this course. I'm not crazy about the fill-in-the-blank style of the programming assignments. I think I'd learn the material better if it just gave me the arguments and returns of the functions and forced me to write everything in between. I think it makes sense to emphasize keras in the later parts of this sequence, but I feel like I never got a basic introduction to how models in keras are supposed to be structured. Maybe there should be an assigned reading on this, if not a video or an optional programming assignment."
2569,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great content, and leaves me set to build systems making predictions for or conversions between sequences- particularly including text posts, which are an interest of mine."
2570,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I found the first week of this course a bit tough compared to all the other 4 courses in this specialization. Perhaps there should be one more week to give much more programming exerises to help understand the concepts clearly. But having said that, the last two weeks, especially the last one about hot-word, is very neatly done and provides very good understanding of such models are implemented. Overall satisfied. Thanks Andrew and team, I feel much more confident in my understanding of these terms and the concepts behind them."
2571,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I never been exposed to this subject Sequence Models before. I learned a lot from this course. But the materials is more advanced than all previous ones, especially the program exercises. The exercise guideline is helpful but not leave many guess works for students not well skilled in Python and Keras. I completed the program exercises by blindly trying different keras commands. "
2572,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall, it is very good course unless for some minor problems with the assignments."

2646,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Great Learning
2647,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course has excellent content. Unfortunately there seems to be a slight drop in quality compared to the other courses in this series, with respect to the programming assignments. I didn't find them to be very clearly explained or illuminating. "
2648,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures were outstanding (as usual), but the programming assignments (except for the final Trigger Word assignment) were terrible.  I spent almost all my time trying to figure out Keras syntax, without ever having a Keras tutorial or anything.  If you are going to rely on Keras, you should probably add a tutorial or some references.  A lot of wasted time.  But other than that, this course was amazing."
2649,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good course. I liked the speech recognition part more. I found the assignments involving Keras code difficult to do in both RNN and CNN courses. Without the help of discussion forum i wouldn't have completed the Keras assignments. Thank you all the fellow students and mentors for your contributions to the discussion forum. Thank you so much Andrew and team for putting this awesome specialization :)
2650,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As the other courses in this series, this is definitely another great course, and explains to details the various sequence models. I gave it 4 stars because I believe it might need some improvements. Compared to the previous courses it felt a little rushed, and had too much new information and long programming exercises for a single week. Maybe it would have been better if it was 4 weeks instead of 3."
2651,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Always a great course but I would expect to have more lessons on how to use Keras and Tensor Flow API in a better way for who needs to use them in real NLP applications. I still have some doubts on how to use them correctly (for example the use of time distributed layer in the last exercise 'trigger word detection' that we didn't use in the architecture for the exercise about attention mechanism)
2652,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot. The descriptions of GRUs and LSTMs were a little scant, however, and I found myself rewatching the videos trying to get my head around them. The course could be improved by going into a little more detail about the different gates and what it means to train them, or what sorts of information or patterns might be relevant for the training of a gate."
2653,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Although I loved the course and learnt a lot, I don't feel as confident trying to implement some sort of sequence modelling in practice compared to the other courses. And yet I still got full marks for this section. I think the course could have been spread out to 4 weeks with a few extra examples (maybe some stock market prediction examples). Regardless, thank you so much for the teachings!"
2654,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I really enjoyed learning this course and gained a lot of knowledge from it. The only challenge that I found was some of the steps of the assignments were not clear. I could resolve them by checking the forum. I would also like to know more about document summary and document similarity, but there was not much content for it. Overall, thanks a lot for putting this valuable content together. "
2655,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great material and amazing Andrew Ng (5 stars) but very pure editoral review (videos with a lot of repeats of canceled phrases, pauses, quiz understanding, grader problems, very poorness of mentors support because they can do nothing to help, neither contact deeplearning.ai, in summary it's looks like alpha version of course not release and diserve 3 or even 2 stars), so in total 4 stars."
2656,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course is almost as good as the prior four, but some of the lectures lack detail, there are mistakes in some quizzes, and the programming assignments at times are crammed too full of information. You can end up passing through this class without really understanding what's going on, whereas the CNN class does a much better job of forcing you to understand things before you pass. "
2657,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Excellent lecture content.
2658,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures were great, making an advanced subject accessible. The course materials were mostly good -- the exception being the optional (non-graded) assignment in Week 1, which was not well-structured, and failed to reinforce the concepts it was intended to. There were challenges with connectivity to the Jupyter notebook server, which caused much frustration and wasted time."
2659,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Another great course by Prof. Ng. The reason for 4 stars is that I found the assignments to gloss over a lot of new Keras ideas (for Keras beginners) at the expense of spending more time on how the ideas were being implemented. I think the course should be spread out over more weeks, say 5, and spend the extra time going into more depth around the Keras model architectures."
2660,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,In the lecture videos there have been quite a few repetitions and in the programming exercises the necessary Keras background has not been delivered. For this I have to subtract one star.
2661,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course could have covered topics like time-series modeling for prediction (sales, demand, a machine failure in a factory, etc) that is much more applicable than some of the assignments proposed here (half of them seemed to be just for fun). Also, I am a little dissapointed that the course didn't cover chatbots, which is one of the most widely used applications for RNNs."
2662,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course was nice but more mathematics could be taught in the lectures, especially backpropagation in recurrent network. Also I feel there could be one more week in this course where recent models like Transformers and BERT can be taught. Overall a nice course to get familiar with Word Embeddings, LSTM, GRU, and some other topics like Translation and Speech Recognition."
2663,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The discussion felt really complicated at points. Also I was disappointed not to be able to complete the optional assignment for LSTM back propagation. Since it is ungraded, it would have been nice to at least see the correct implementation to learn from. Also there were several errors in the expected values or instructions in the assignments, that were really confusing."
2664,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The instructor Andrew Sir is excellent in conveying topics, but I just found the last part a bit dry compared to the previous 4. "
2665,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Ths course really shows cutting edge technology such as using deep networks consisting of LSTMs, GRUs etc.. I especially liked the audio trigger word recognition."
2666,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It has been quite a good course to explain the tedious concepts of RNN.
2667,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Concur with other reviewers: this class was good, covering a lot of interesting material and with well-structured quizzes & assignments. But the lectures seemed to skip past the sorts of in-depth explanations I wanted, instead just getting to the end point of ""this is what this looks like"". So good, but not quite as good as previous courses in the specialization."
2668,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course is great to get intuitive understanding of Word Embeddings, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs and Attention Models."
2669,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Really cool applications to work on, but the videos got a little too much into specific applications that may not be relevant most of the time.  It was all interesting, but it made this course a lot longer each week.  I could have done without a lot of the specifics of certain applications, just because it will be hard to apply/remember the concepts anyways."
2670,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I like the course for the very deep understanding of sequence models. But I really didn't like some practical tasks (especially closer to the end of course) as they are quite difficult to debug. It takes much time and doesn't get the feeling you understand how to handle with problems. Would love to have some insights about improving models debugging skill.
2671,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"All courses in this specialization are awesome. However, this last course feels a little rushed in comparison with the other 4 courses. While the first 3 courses raise your knowledge of ANN in preparation to the 4th one, it is a little more difficult to understand this 5th course. Likewise, completing the assignments is possible, but more frustrating."
2672,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It's a great course. The information and knowledge that you get about Sequence Models is fantastic as a primer. Andrew is an amazing teacher throughout the entire specialization altough I found the content of the videos in the Sequence Models slightly more rushed than the previous 4 courses...
2673,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The theory was absolutely interesting and an eye-opener. The programming exercises were hard to make because of the keras/tensorflow knowledge and I actually ended up just fill-in in things, as were given in the examples, without really knowing what I was doing. Time for a Tensorflow course."
2674,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Poderia dar um pouco mais de instruções na hora de usar as funções do Keras. Ficou um pouco confuso. 
2675,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Though the lessons are interesting and mathematically demanding, I felt that it was a good time spent learning these concepts. Overall I feel that the 3 weeks could be split into 4 weeks and learning could have been much smoother by adding some more lessons to address the contents of Week 2. "
2676,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I Love it! every single part of the course!
2677,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Nice content, but the assignments are too easy and only demonstrate the pipeline instead of providing hand-on experience in picking the network and training with GPU. Also, there are some grader problems which has wasted my time to make my code pass the grader even if the answer is correct."
2678,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The homework grading methods need improvement. I got the right model and get the right results, but still have to spend tons of time to make the submission pass the grading system. It is a waste of time for future learning.  You may want to train a DL model to solve this grading problem :). "
2679,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great explanation of theory (RNNs etc.) and easy to follow course structure. The programming exercises are disappointing though: They mostly consist of mindlessly copying Keras functions without an understandable (!) explanation. Many provided links to the Keras documentation are outdated.
2680,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Assignment for week 4 offered little instruction. The exercises for implementing the 
2681,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Obviously, The professor and TAs have put a lot of time for preparation of this course, and I really appreciate it. However, the hws of the course is too much focused on language translation. They could put another examples, say business data, to represent other applications of RNN/LSTMs."
2682,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course should provide more instruction on the Keras and Tensorflow, since the notebook is largely dependent on the knowledge of these frameworks. Moreover, the logic of programming is not so well-organized: I personally prefer to have my own logic instead of modules got implemented :)"
2683,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Really interesting course with overview about sequence models and what can you do with them. Lectures from prof. NG are amazing as usual. The only thing I was missing was maybe more tutorials on Keras LSTM usage. The exercises on LSTM were quite confusing, especially using shared layers.  "
2684,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very Important !!!
2685,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I am overwhelmed by too much material. Additionally Tensorflow and Keras syntax is not very elegant or coherent as they are such high-level languages. I learnt a lot at a high-level overview in this course, but my fundamental understanding was consolidated in the previous 4 courses."
2686,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Finally, the last course was completed. For me, this course is very difficult, because the content of the course is somewhat obscure and difficult to understand. But I learned some basic knowledge about Natural Language Processing and Speech Recognition through this course. Thanks!"
2687,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Insightful course though I wish the course would be longer and more spelled out, since sequence models are quite complicated and harder to understand. Instructions on programming exercises are also sometimes pretty unclear, especially in later weeks. Still, overall a great course."
2688,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This is my third course in Deep Learning, the contents and pace of learning are great, they provide a good level of understanding in the subject. The notebooks have bugs and I wasted a lot of times making them work, thus they could be improved to use that time actually learning."
2689,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The concepts presented in this course were advanced enough. Yet, the assignments did not require much effort and thinking, which in my opinion is hurting the learning process. If students do not struggle enough with the course, they tend to forget the material they have learned."
2690,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very interesting courses. I take this as a basis for future applications. I only regret that the exercises are too guided. I can't pretend to be able to accomplish a project in machine learning :-(
2691,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great content, assignments are fun and reasonably instructive (although they contain the occasional error and the video editing for the lecture content seems a bit rushed at times). I would recommend this course as an introduction to recurrent neural networks and related ideas."
2692,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Course is about recurrent neural networks, natural language processing and basics of speech recognition. Valuable content and great delivery by the author expect the final week where it's difficult to understand the transformers network and the related programming assignment."
2693,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very informative and well taught course on sequence models. The amount of content and pacing was just right as not to be overwhelmingly complicated. There are a few bugs here and there in the programming exercise which can lead to a lot of headaches but overall a good course!
2694,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, with interesting programming assignments, but still, I couldn't catch intuition about GRU and LSTM nature (I understood its pupuse and equations but couldn't get why exactly THAT combination of equations is necessary to allow RNN learn long term dependencies)."
2695,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Week 3: quite a complected network was used for trigger word detection; however, it is not clear why exactly this architecture was used; specific order of dropout, batchnorm and GRU seems to be a pure magic; at least, a few words why this combination is picked are needed."
2696,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"very good hands-on course. Yet I wished in the programming assignments, it was stated clearer, whether the implemented code is for understanding purposes only (and hence being the reason to be implemented) or is still mandatory even when working within a library (keras). "
2697,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Guys, just the truth: Content: Great. Mr. Ng: Great. Autograder: Complete and utter BS. If you rework the Infrastructure you will be big. If you further refuse to do so (literally thousands of complaints about the autograder in the forums -> nothing happens) you will not. Check out Scala courses approach with grading -> works like a charm. Cheers, JJ"
2698,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The content is generally great and well worth it. I wish they would fix 
some of the errors, especially in ungraded exercises. You end up wasting
 a lot of time because of them. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect is 
navigating to the Jupyter notebooks. I wish the links to the notebooks 
were on the same pages as the Submission and Discussion links."
2699,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I learned a lot. I would give 5 starts but the jupyter notebooks were very very buggy.  I spent half of my time on the homework going through the forums to find workarounds.  It took away from learning the material efficiently.  
2700,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is very interesting and it gives an insight into recurrent neural networks (RNN). The practical exercises are interesting but I found them in a bit raw state compared to the previous courses of the Deep Learning Specialization. Nevertheless I would still highly recommend to follow this course. Thanks a lot to organizers. 
2701,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Everything seems logical, except the programming assignments. Although I went through week 1 programming assignments only, I often had to face some problems with insufficient information. Lecture videos are easy to understand, but not all the details are explained. (This is the point where I need to find some information by hand.)"
2702,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As a non-computer science background student, the course was overwhelming, I got lost in the equations most of the time. Maybe a lower level course could be considered before starting this one. Nevertheless, this was an informative course about sequence models. Lots of quizzes and programming assignments reinforced my learning."
2703,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Videos are great; but as usual TP are too guided (hence boring) and do not use today frameworks (Pytorch, tensorflow 2). TPs should either be completely coded by candidates (only introduction + resfresh on concepts + objectives) with evaluation on final accuracy/f1 score <or> they should be no TPs at all and more MCQ tests "
2704,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Content her is great - the first week covers the basic RNN models in a very clear way and the assignments are interactive and interesting, building on the explanations in lectures. One downsides is that the production quality is poor and would benefit from some re-recording to remove bloopers and make it smoother to watch."
2705,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I wish it was a bit more interesting. It also kinda feels like Andrew has a bit of a problem himself in understanding the paradigms stated in this course, and that makes me feel somewhat confused as well. Would recommend for the math, the notations are weird and confusing sometimes but it is understandable for most parts."
2706,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This is a very interesting course with good explanations, which give a brief but sufficient introduction to sequential models like GRU and LSTM. One star is dropped because the CNN course (#4) is still better than this one in terms of explanations, while course #2 is better in terms of relevant material and pace (to me). "
2707,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Although I really really really love this series and although I always gave 5 stars, I think the quality of this last module is a lot less better than the previous ones. I think convolution was way more difficult but the explanation was awesome. Unfortunately, i think explanations in this module are a little sloppy. "
2708,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As usual, Andrew Ng's stellar talent as an educator shines through. Unfortunately, some of the video editing is a little scrappy, and the assignments could use some more polish. Especially in areas where they catch quirks in the grader. Luckily the forum support is excellent. This course is definitely worth doing. "
2709,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall nice course, learned a lot about NLP and Speech to text. Course is more oriented towards NLP applications, I was also hoping to learn more about time series analysis. Feel like the course could have been longer 4-5 weeks since RNN, LSTM and GRU is pretty long topic and 3 weeks seems to be too short for it. "
2710,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Recomiendo ampliamente este curso, te proporciona un claro entendimiento de los modelos secuenciales y recurrentes. Es excelente, aunque a diferencia de otros cursos de esta especialización no explicaron en detalle algunos aspectos de las RNN, me hubiese gustado que profundizaran un poco más en backpropagation."
2711,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The RNN, LSTM< and GRU were very good. But the Week 3seemed a bit abstract. More could have been covered in Audio, Attention."
2712,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This course provided a nice high level overview of RNN models and associated Keras implementations. The tricks and tips given were a useful addition to my ML arsenal. The only thing that I feel discredits this course is that the programming assignments are easy to gloss over and pass without much engagement. 
2713,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great introduction to RNNs and how to implement them in keras.  I suspect it is a relatively new course as there are still typos and a few errors in the assignments (otherwise I would have given 5 stars) but the forums help you to find your way around them and hopefully in future versions they will be fixed.
2714,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent lectures, some part was difficult and it took time for me to imagine the content of each parameter (e.g. when we talk about X, or a, or Waa what is the size of them and what do they represent). But in the exercises, it became more understandable. Exercises need previous knowledge of Keras and OOP."
2715,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It is a fabulous course content-wise. However, I personally find the programming exercises overly easy (the instructors already build the framework for you and the only thing you need to do is to fill in the blanks),  s.t. I'm still not able to build an RNN from scratch after completing all those exercises."
2716,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course is good. It introduces the concepts regarding recurrent models. I specially like the attention model videos. In general, the exercises are well written. However, I'm not very familiar with Keras and working on the Keras code really takes my time even I'm quite experienced with Tensorflow."
2717,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Professor Ng did a good job explaining sequence model and I finally understand the basic theories. However, there is room to improve especially on the Keras library part. I hope you can add some simple tutorial for that. Also, I still don't understand how to translate the architecture to Keras code."
2718,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This is a very well structured course. I initially started this course almost 10 months ago but got distracted and started to learn sequence models on my own. But, at the end end I resorted to this course again and got my basics cleared out. Thanks to deeplearning.ai team for designing this course!"
2719,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great explanations on the videos, and well designed programming exercises. However, the complexity of the programming tasks is not well dimensioned (1h - 1:30 h may be too little). Worse, some of the exercises are not well explained, with misleading information (e.g. about model tensor dimensions)."
2720,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"this is a well structured course, but it is not for beginners at all, andrew ng had put alot of his efforts in this. As a computer science major, I was able to grasp the maths concepts but for anyone comming from diffrent background its far from possible to understand all the theoratical concepts."
2721,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"There was not enough theory as the first three courses. Some explanations were superficial and difficult to understand. Maybe drawing the shape of the inputs, outputs, and other matrices in lectures would help to better visualize what's going on inside the networks. Overall, it was a great course."
2722,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Much more challenging than the other courses in the DL specialisation. It forced me to delve a little deeper into the topic in order to overcome obstacles in the assignments. Content-wise, it's a great introduction to DL for NLP. Professor Ng's explanations are perfect."
2723,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course itself is cutting-edge, so a 5-star for this."
2724,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"In general, about all the specialization, I think that some of the programming assigments could be more didactive to understand the concepts of the courses and not to find what the code is doing in that specific task. For all the others aspects of the course I think it's perfect for a litlle bit more than an introduction."
2725,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It's a good intro to RNNs (LSTMS and GRU).  Very interesting use cases for RNNs. I feel that there could have been more room to try more programming exercises for different use cases & RNN architectures. Be aware that Keras is very sensitive to changes and you will find yourself reloading the jupyter kernels repeateadly when you get stuck. This is not a problem of the course itself but it is something that could end up wasting a lot of your time chasing problems when your code actually should work.  
2726,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lecture videos are great. Andrew is a great teacher in teaching concepts at the most intuitive level. By the time I finished the course, I had sufficient knowledge to be able to read and understand the paper. "
2727,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Another great course by Andrew Ng! This course is part of the CS230 class currently being taught at Stanford University. Only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that at this stage (April 2018), there are few knowledgeable mentors and virtually no Instructors present in the Forum. Course provides little introduction to the syntax of Keras, which makes for some problems implementing models. Therefore one might spend a lot of time spinning one's wheels until finding a way forward."
2728,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This last course is the most difficult challenge in the entire specialization, I personally have to watch back the video lectures many times. But I appreciate Andrew's efforts in transmitting knowledge in the most possibly understandable way.
In the assignment section, I found it necessary to have advanced experience in Python to be able to comprehend. Even if you have completed all the exercises, I believe most of you would only understand about 30-40% what you were doing."
2729,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As with all the 5 courses in the Deep Learning Specialization, the video lectures were amazing, thoughtfully designed (and separated) and gave an understandable overview of the content. As for the programming assignements, some lack a clear description of what is to do - that mostly concerns single steps withing a sub-task though. Tensorflow and Keras need a considerable amount of self-study next to the lectures to truly understand what you are doing there."
2730,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"NLP is definitely my favorite application of DL. This course was fun, although W4's assignment was quite confusing. Maybe it'd be nice to clarify that though the labs are ungraded, they'll help the learner deepen understanding of concepts and to explicitely recommend that they're completed before the assignment, so overall learning process becomes smoother. "
2731,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Theoretical knowledge gained during this course is good, for beginners in this area they learn what can be done and how. Only minus is practical assignements which are too straightforward, it's helpfull to have guide what to do, but maybe some assignement which doesn't have too much of a guide could be good (not necessarily the one which is graded but something which makes you to think a little bit more rather than follow the tips and writing Python code)."
2732,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I enjoyed this course very much. The videos were very informative covering a lot of ground in RNNs. I also enjoyed the assignments which covered both implementation of RNNs from scratch to get a good feel for it, and practical implementations. I was a bit disappointed about NLP section as it brushed over word embedding and left me without much understanding on how they are estimated. I would also like to have seen time-series covered in this course."
2733,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I loved all of the courses in the specialization. However, last two (sequence models and convolutional NNs) had in my opinion poor exercises, not well described, or emphasizing the parts which are not that important, omitting at the same time more important topics. For example the last exercise with spectogram was mainly focused on preparing the data rather than explaining/practicing algorithms. All in all, I gave 4/5 which is still very good grade. "
2734,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I dont understand why notebooks are become unavailable when I am working on it. It says method not allowed and then please login through www.coursera.org. Then I had to run all the cells again. I think this is because of the lack of resources like # of servers available. Other than that, like the content of the programming assignments. Especially the trigger word detection algorithm worked perfect with my own voice, that was satisfying of course."
2734,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course covers one of the most influential developments in deep learning in recent times, and does so in a thorough way, introducing majority of the relevant mathematics and methods necessary to build a variety of sequence models."
2735,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This course is a great introduction to sequence models and a great way of finishing the specialization. All main areas were covered. It is a good entry point for those who want to keep improving their sequence-models skills. 
2736,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I got an overview of how people use this technology but the whole network architecture and especially dimensioning remains to be somewhat of a black art. 
2737,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Awesome course.  It feels like this one was more rushed than the others in the Specialization.  I am a bit concerned whether the ""Specialization"" has become a ""Survey"" of the course, and leans heavily on the assignments for teaching..but then, could do more for why some architectures are the way they are.  The assignments improved from being a spoon-feeding exercise. That's good.  But, on the other side, Keras documentation was confusing."
2738,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The 5th course materials were not as solid as the previous 4 courses. Mainly due to heavily use of Keras API and lack of Numpy implementation. There is nothing to complain about indeed as for the same amount of content the 5th courses had covered, implementing on Numpy will take way longer. Maybe adding more explanation on how the Keras API work will help a tons. Overall it is a very good course that I would recommend anyone to enroll."
2739,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is really good if you want to get a good understanding on the basics of deep learning. It would have been great if the course had more hand's on assignments than fill in the blanks kind of assignments in ipython notebook. 
2740,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I learnt a lot from this course and the whole specialization. I am grateful to the mentors and instructors. If coursera gives me opportunity I can also be mentor for the specialization to help the newcomers through the assignments. 
2741,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"During the first week, I think that a deeper explanation of the matrices' dimensions throughout the NNs should be given. Indeed, this would be helpful to understand some concepts."
2742,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course was good except first week. I did not learn as much as I would like from the programming exercises of week 1. It could be nice to have 4 weeks instead of 3 for this course. Taking more time to cover the week 1 material.
2743,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent series of courses! Loved the lectures and thoroughly enjoyed the exercises! A big thanks to Andrew Ng and all the instructors and mentors. The forums provided useful hints on the couple of occasions I was stuck. While I would have initially suggested providing more info on Keras APIs, in hindsite the additional time spent in searching Keras documentation was useful arriving at better understanding of the infrastructure."
2744,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The Literature for RNN's was not motivating enough compared to Convolutional Networks and the previous courses. However, Andrew did concentrate on the important aspects which would help us in building RNN ourselves. I did feel the assignments were not as elaborative and extensive as the CNN's but I understand the idea behind it (being just to make users aware of the skeleton of the model instead of doing everything from scratch). "
2745,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This one is much better then the previous one - Coursera team definitely made their homework. However some theoretical blank-spaces are still left. For instance - nothing is said about how recursive gates are being updated during BPTT backward pass. For someone who has the some experience and read some other sources that is not a big deal, but for a complete first-timer who pays attention and uses his brain - this is a pure flaw."
2746,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Everything is perfect, the teaching is excellent, the only problem is the jupyter notebook, its sometimes difficult to debug issues and takes a lot of time and is kind of vague as well in terms of application of the lectures."
2747,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Thanks to Andrew Ng and his amazing team, this course challenged my fundamental knowledge of Tensorflow and ML algorithms in the most useful way. However, I expected more applying libraries to design the NLP recent products. "
2748,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"some topics not explained in detail. Not enough examples to understand some models completely. As an example, I didn't fully understand what are the parameters for the models, their shapes, and how they are used in the model"
2749,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course! But I find the transformer assignment bit difficult. I think if the implementation would be covered in a 10-15 minutes video it would be a lot more easier to understand. Thank you for the great specialisation!
2750,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall it was pretty informational on introducing NLP to me. However, Keras was a little bit frustrating to learn at the beginning. I found out the forum was a very good resource to learn Keras syntax whenever I was stuck."
2751,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course! I do feel like I'm just scratching the surface of the types of applications that I can make. I think the coding segments still hold our hands a little too much, but you can't beat the clarity of the lectures. "
2752,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course lecture is grade but I hope the assignment is better in guiding structure, something the explanation is hard to follow, and the assignment should include the transfer learning instead of using the trained model."
2753,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very interesting application of deep learning. Gives a good overview. Assignments are fun, yet it's too easy to complete the assignments without understanding the big picture. I found the ""attitude"" assignment in week 3 a bit difficult to grasp however. Particularly liked the dinosaur names, emojify, the humour and positivity in the course: mentioning gender/racial bias, encouraging people to do good with their skills. Namaste!"
2754,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good overall. Andrew Ng explains the material clearly and accessibly.
2755,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I thought the course and the specialization was great for people who want to get into the details of deep learning. Although I enjoyed learning about all the details, I wish there was a separate course specifically for Keras and TensorFlow. In practice, we will rarely have to implement the models from scratch, and having a better understanding of Keras and TensorFlow would be more helpful in terms of career prospects. "
2756,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This was hard to keep up with, maybe too hard. The assignments' difficulty also was on a different level then the lectures maybe there more time should be put into the lecture videos as it was the case for DNN and RNN."
2757,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The videos and programming exercises were very interesting and insightful. My only complain is some of notebooks for exercises include errors and it was just a time-wasting  task to find the ""trick"" to pass the grader."
2758,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The content is well captured and Andrew really helps build the required intuitions. But, the assignments are too guided. There is no room to struggle for solutions which often proves to be the main source of learning."
2759,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I think the transformer programming exercise of this fifth course is not as good as the others. The methods we must implement are not clearly explained and the research on these really took me a huge amount of time.
2760,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The exercises are too short and too basic for this course specifically. The task is a great learning experience but there is not much one would struggle with in terms of difficulty as there is too much spoon feeding.
2761,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great video lectures, but practical assignments are a pain due to awful auto-grading system and programming expirience in Jupyter in general. Most of the time you'll be searching for an error that isn't really there."
2762,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent course, excellent lecturer. Unfortunately some of the test data (week3/lab/trigger word detection/XY_dev/* CANNOT BE DOWNLOADED ... The programming lab sections are nice - sometime a bit too helped ... ;) "
2763,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Andrew has a very good video-lecture style.  
2764,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Presentation is amazing... Professor Ng always does fantastic job of communicating the material in a clear and easily understood way.
2766,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It is better to talk more about bi-directional RNN and give assightment about it before week three and week four. Moreover, it is also better to give two more weeks to talk more about the material in week 3 and 4."
2767,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Programming exercises did show you quite a bit, but got complex enough that most of my time was spent reading and understanding the preamble than doing any programming. That being said it delivered on the promise."
2768,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Course content is really good! However, I found it quite difficult to truly understand deep learning algorithms. However, it provides good glimpse of of sequence models and intuitions behind various useful models."
2769,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course and material, Andrew NG really know who to explain difficult subjects in an intuitive way. However, the course seems that it still needs some work (there are some bugs in the lectures and assignments)"
2770,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures are suitable. Andrew, as always, is very clear and goes into necessary detail on each topic."
2771,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The NLP Section of this course is quite difficult to understand(The Notations are quite confusing as well as prior knowledge is required to understand) but other than that RNN, GRU, LTSM are explained clearly."
2771,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very useful materials, but a little hard to digest. It will be more helpful if course lectures and slides can dive a little deeper into each model and provide more granular technical details."
2773,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Exercises are sometimes vague and can be done without full understanding of the material. No officially given notes. No reading material that explains the concepts more clearly and in detail.
2774,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,One of the best course i ever taken. glad to be part of such wonderful course teach by prof.andrew ng. learn a lot about sequence model and NLP. Highly Highly recommended for beginner in NLP 
2775,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great Course, very insightful excercises, really enjoyed it - unfortunately some issues with the programming excercises."
2776,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"the course content was really impressive, but some topics need to be explained in detail. Also working of LSTM should be further described in detail. Programming assignments are really fun."
2777,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"great course, lots of implementation details that are important were glossed over, while other areas had too much hw hand-holding + strict requirements on what the code needed to look like."
2778,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very glad I took this course!  A little rough around the edges as far as video / assignment quality, but seeing that this is the very first run of this course, I know it will only improve."
2779,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The material was great. Some of the programming assignments ramped up in difficulty or lack of perfect execution. However, I still gained extremely valuable information from this course. "
2780,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The lecture for Sequence model was good motivation to get interesting about text and audio processing. All of lectures were very fundamental and intuitive. Thank you very much. Prof. Ng.
2781,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good and fun course in the sequence. However, it would be very nice if there were some examples of using RNN for things such as self driving etc, outside the realm of speech and NLP"
2782,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course videos are very good. However the optional parts of assignments have lots of issues and errors. Please update the assignment to reduce the time wasted unnecessarily debugging.
2783,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very interesting exercice and assignments from which a lot is to learn. Content quite complicated which will require from me to come back for review and deepen some points. Thank you !
2784,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It was necessary to study extensively the Keras framework to fulfill the code tasks. I suggest an extra module with small simple RNN modeling exercises to better adapt the framework.
2785,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall, I really like this module. One possible improvement might be providing more information for backpropagation. Maybe as an optional video or just reading materials. Thank you."
2786,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,nice course even few chapters could be more detailled technically speaking. However the assignements are very nice and helps to complete the understanding. Many thanks for such work
2787,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Thank you Andrew Ng for making me comfortable with the deep learning topics on Sequential data...Assessments were interesting ..can be made to enable us better play with the models
2788,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Week 2 was wonderful to learn and understand. I wish to explore more on LSTM and Attention based models. Video lectures were not enough for me. Still I am happy for what I learnt.
2789,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Overall it is a good course. Much need to improve on the feedback of grading of which output is not really helping. Referring to global variables in assignments are really tricky.
2790,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall a very good course , i wish the model construction ( i.e. the rationale in stacking up the layers) is covered in bit more detail, otherwise an excellent course, no doubt."
2791,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The assignments can be made a little difficult. Can Include assignments of Image captioning, that would have been great. Overall a great course. Sir Andrew Ng, superb teaching!!"
2792,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,great course as always by andrew. would give it a 5/5 but had some sloppy mistakes regarding the formulas. overal impression : exceptional and highly recommended. thanks andrew!
2793,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Compared to the previous courses, this one was a little hard for me. Because Dr. Andrew tried to squeezed a bunch of information in this course. It's a wonderful course though."
2794,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some of the assignments are very difficult to pass. I think I understand the concepts but the instructions for the assignments could be a lot clearer and provide more guidance.
2795,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is great. The assignment sessions are a little confusing. It would be good to show the complete codes for the test cases so that test errors can be easier to debug. 
2796,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I did not feel like I got a super clear understanding on how to use various library functions in keras, I did gain a really good understanding of the underlying models though! "
2797,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Week1 lessons are a little complex than the previous classes and there are gaps between ground-up python version and keras version of LSTM model. Keras will need to be taught a bit more in detail to follow up. 
2798,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This is by far the hardest course in the specialization. But it was explained well. My only complain is there were errors in the first programming exercise. All in all, I learned a lot in this specialization."
2799,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great content! I really love Andrew's teaching style. (1 star deduction for some programming assignments where I spent time debugging but it turned out that the point deduction was due to the grading system.)
2800,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Overall course content is great but I feel like improvements can be made on the lab exercises to give students concrete understanding along with hands-on experience. A great job by the deeplearning.AI team.
2801,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The programming exercises are a little heavy in this course where we need to load and re-load for them to give correct output even if the code had been correct all throughout. Otherwise, the course is great."
2802,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"4 stars and not 5 stars because the course is shorter than the others and it feels like an exemple in classical forecasting is lacking (sales, time series...). "
2803,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It's an excellent course! I will give it 5 stars if it could offer more interesting and meaningful assignments(Not offend, but it a little too easy and the assignments are not very related to the real work). "
2804,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course should contain more explanation about natural language processing like tf-idf,lemmatization,stemming,dialog flow. Although i got a good explanation of working of RNNs,LSTM and machine translation"
2805,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course to start off with sequence model. The programming exercises were in depth and deliver a great learning experience. Would love to see more of sequence literature in the course's future versions.
2806,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Again a brilliant course from Andrew NG, but though and dense this time. In order to grasp the meanings videos and lectures need to be revised a few times. Also, get some extra info elsewhere does not hurt."
2807,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent presentation, and interesting assignments. One star dropped because a couple of technical issues with the assignment material (typos in the mathematical formulas / expected results here and there)"
2808,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The contents are great as always.  However, the server is not reliable.  Once, the grader is down and you can't submit homework.  For another time, the connection is lost and all the changes made are lost."
2809,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, but I felt the gap between the very high level lectures and very low level labs was a bit too wide. I had some issues with the autograder and losing progress in the notebook between sessions."
2810,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course. The only frustrating part are the programming assignments as it is very cumbersome to have to go thru the discussion forums to resolve issues. Tough to find helpful insights thru the forums. 
2811,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Andrew Ng is perfect like everytime. I didn't have any issue with programming exercises unlike other comment so probably it fixed. I wish course  to be more detailed especially training word vectors part. 
2812,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very well produced and explained.  In my case, the nature of the Sequence Model makes understanding the concepts and finishing the assignment more challenging than other segments of the specialization."
2813,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is very short when compared to first 3 courses in this series. It would have been better if more explanation and shorter assignments were provided in the initial weeks and increase the pace.
2814,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The previous courses raised the bar and expectations. The assignments for Week 1 and Week 2 were a bit unclear. Lectures for Week 1 and Week 2 can be improved as well. Besides, this is a great course!"
2815,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The material itself is very informative and useful. But I have to give ""just"" 4 stars because, the training videos have to be edited better and there were a few mistakes in the programing exercises."
2816,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Please work on getting the notebooks to work properly. Also very bummed that after canceling my subscription, I won't have access to my homeworks. You guys should give us lifelong access - we paid!"
2817,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A general overview into the power of sequence models. There is no rigorous mathematics here so most of what students can learn is high-level implementation and intuition about the various models. 
2818,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Es el mas complejo de todos los cursos de la certificación, faltna alguna traducciones que lo hacen  un poco mas dificil de entender algunos conceptos, pero leyendo y probando se logra entender. "
2819,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great  final module !
2820,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"An appropriate course for getting started with Recurrent Neural Networks and its very applications in the domains of speech recognition, sentiment classification, neural machine translation etc"
2821,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall teaching of Andrew Ng sir is Fabulous, but it was very hectic with the technical problem of the last assignment and I would like to thank Andrew Ng sir for the teaching me this course"
2822,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It was great course, "
2823,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is the course 5 week 4 coding assignment. See my comments in response to post by @marcus-waldman for detail
2824,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,too much content and not much chance to exercise. I will suggest for more frequently and smaller programming assignments through out the course!
2825,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Outstanding course, but the end of it uses many architectures not fully explained (GRU and such). Incredible course and specialization, though!"
2826,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent course, but I would have liked to work on predictive maintenance examples leveraging RNN and LSTM networks. Big thanks to whole team."
2827,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is nicely designed and every topic is explained in a very lucid manner by Andrew Ng. Must be done as a beginner in sequence models.
2828,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Simplified content delivered in just the right way to give a perfect intuition of the complex concepts. Really enjoyed doing the whole course. 
2829,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great content, but Andrew often starts his phrases then restarts saying them. Audio could use some cleanup, then this course would be perfect!"
2830,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Most optional assignments contain bugs/errors. Other than that, this is a great course, just as the 4 other courses in this specialist series."
2831,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I give 4 star because some fomulas are not correct! Though this course is really great. I can not understand why you made mistakes on fomulas.
2832,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great materials and programming exercises. The programing exercise in week 4 could be improved for the more beginner-friendly style probably.
2833,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This one seemed to go through to quickly over the details especially with the word vectors and the LSTM, would have appreciated more examples"
2834,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good course, though the assignments towards the end were a little too centered around Keras, which I personally don't care for very much"
2835,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The instruction of using Keras in the programming assignment is unclear. There are many bugs as well, hence we have versions 1, 2 and 3 etc."
2836,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"No time series analysis, and some problems in the guidance of some programming tasks. Mainly de first week, the rest of it was pretty good."
2837,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good course. I would suggest to split the first week into 2 weeks, which makes easier to grasp all the concept with a deeper understanding."
2838,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some assignments don't have enough descriptions to help me deeply understand the core concept of the algorithms. Hope it can be improved.
2839,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The assignments of this course ""Sequence Models"" require sufficient knowledge of Keras and Tensorflow, which is not friendly to beginners. "
2840,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"There are some problems in the code of the assignments, as well as the expected outputs, which costs a lot of time for me to figure out. "
2841,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very Awesome Course i got knowledge about  Sequence to Sequence models and how they works in practical software . Thanks to Prof.Andrew.
2842,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Exercises' grader didn't accept all the functions correctly, lose much time searching in the discussion."
2843,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"First three chapters where just great, fourth was very good, but fifth was not very understable and assisgnments were quite annoying."
2844,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great instructor, good and challenging assignments. Thank you!"
2845,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Everything is great except the last assignment - trigger word detection is hard to save and submit, and i can't even open it sometime. "
2846,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course (except from the last assignment, that was extremely difficult in comparison to other assigments). Totally recomended!!!"
2847,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,good 
2848,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,good

2859,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,ok
2859,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The time allocated to some of the assigments should be increased. The estimated time in many cases seems to assume that one is aware of Keras and Tensorflow

2872,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,赞
2873,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Well-made course, but unfortunately there are tons of mistakes in the programming assignments - in the comments, formulas, even in the prepared code pieces. "
2874,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The best course in the Deep Learning Specialization. Really good and well explained. There are some problems and mistakes in the problem assignments though.
2875,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Somes basics, tiny bit of theory, a bit of keras and insights for practical tasks. Some strage errors in notebook exercises makes it 2x time longer though."
2876,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course. The only tiny flaw is that the introduction to Tensorflow and Keras was a bit shallow so that I struggled a bit with programming these parts.
2877,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Instructive course with useful concepts. However, there were many more mistakes in the notebooks compared to the previous 4 courses in the specialization."
2878,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Awesome introduction, but feels like Andrew is a little bit rushing since it is the last course in the series, I dont feel it is as clear as other courses"
2879,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The CNN course was better in this series of courses. This course is also good, but more content could be provided. Still the best small course out there."
2880,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Faced issues regarding assignment submissions. Otherwise, the course is perfect. Would upgrade my review to 5 stars if this issue seems to be fixed later"
2881,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The Sequence Models course was the one I sought out in the deep learning specialization. Very interesting assignments, e.g. neural machine translation, music composition, etc. - much more interesting than the convolutional network models, in my opinion. However, it is also much more difficult to follow; probably the most difficult one of the five courses."
2883,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Es buen, algo extenso, pero suficiente para avanzar.  Algo importante es actualizar los cursos con los nuevos algoritmos, al menos uno, por ejemplo BERT."
2884,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course is quite challenging, but at least the concepts were well explained. Wished that Andrew and his team could conduct a crash course on Keras :)"
2885,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"A great intro to RNN, LSTM, GRU, Activation. Programming assignments are rather messy though (unlike those in the other courses of this specialisation)."
2886,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, I like the practical application and assignments discussed in this course , wish latest research papers were also discussed in the course,"
2887,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course introduces mainly about RNN, GRU and LSTM. Great assignments. 1 score off for the in-correction in assignments. 4.5 scores from me actually."
2888,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great lectures, really well explained, assignments could request more from the trainee to devise the logic instead of having it already defined for him."
2889,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good course, however I would like to have more Transformers application in the last part as well as some information regarding the fine tuning of them."
2890,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Thank you very much for all the work you have done. I have learned so many things... I will try to use this stuff  in the coming months. Yours, Thierry"
2891,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course is really good, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn the subject, but it lacks support from the staff in the discussion forums."
2892,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good course. Some editing issues in the lectures and small issues with the programming exercises (outdated Keras instructions and documentation). 
2893,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures are excellent. The assignments are an extremely valid trace of significant deep learning application, while they lack a bit of challenge."
2894,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As always, this course is great. however, for some reason this course is much more difficult then the others, and i feel as if it is packed too much.  "
2895,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Really good course, like the others. A bit too black box in some of the programming exercises, so I expect to struggle when developing my own models."
2896,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The videos are really informative and well structured. However, the exams felt like Keras tests. A detailed Keras tutorial would have been helpful. "
2897,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Parts of the critical details are a little vague, but the intuition and experience provided are extremely valuable and useful for me!"
2898,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Found it a bit harder to follow along. I believe this topic needs a more indepth treatment and possibly more time (4 weeks at least). 
2899,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"
Really good course, but the audio quality (repetitions, periods of silence etc) was decreasing over the course of the specialization

"
2900,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The exercises are somewhat tough for this exercise I think the time should be extended by one week extra to complete the assignment. 
2901,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The material is great. On the other hand, if we could get a lecture on Keras, it would help us work on the programming assignments."
2902,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Besides some technical difficulties in the notebook (and some minor details in the video quality) the course was very informative!
2903,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Overall well executed course and sequence. You'll pick up RNN essentials and use Keras/Tensorflow to work through simple examples.
2904,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Video editing is bad and assignments have lots of inconsistent wording and bugs, apart from that knowledge wise really good course"
2905,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Course was very good and I learned a lot. I think assignments can be more open ended to encourage students to try multiple ideas.
2906,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Assignments were confusing in when they seemed to work but graded wrong and sometimes they were graded correct but didn't work.
2907,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Some programming assignments have few errors in them (wrong equations, wrong expected output etc.) which need to be corrected."
2908,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This course is very useful!!! I want to give you 5 stars but there are a lot of bugs on your practice course. Please check it.
2909,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course. My only complaint is about the assignments. The weren't as polished as in other courses in this specialization.
2910,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"There were some puzzling parts to the programming assignments (number of trainable parameters), but overall very good course."
2911,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"this course seemed glitchy compared to previous courses. some multi-answer quiz questions would only allow one answer, etc."
2912,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent course overall, but the programming assignments left me feeling a it unprepared considering the previous lectures."
2913,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very nicely explained and grateful for that. However, The assignements are little hard to follow from the previous courses."
2914,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I am grateful for this course, it literally is redefining my career and what I want to do. Thanks for the excellent course!"
2915,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,thank you so much for the material. pls do something with assignment of week4 to make it more constructive than confusive.
2916,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Some excercizes were subpar, and some were not interesting, but all in all very good course in which one can learn so much"
2917,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"assignments were good if there is any direct interaction, taking input from the writer itself will be too much excitement."
2918,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A little much in not so much amount of time. Could have had more videos. Otherwise great course and great course material
2919,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good introduction to RNNs, text/music generation, NLP etc."
2920,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Found the embeddings lectures & transformers lectures to be a bit confusing and could give a little bit more explanation
2921,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The low-level framework, such as torch, should be used in the assignment. keras is complicated to understand for newbie."
2922,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Super excited to finish this course. I've tone of questions not answered in forums I'm still waiting answers.
2923,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This was the toughest one of the 5. Great learning, but may be it could've been made a tad bit more intuitive"
2924,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,the course is very comprehensive however more details about how backpropagation is done would be great !!!
2925,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The quiz section needs to improve. It would be helpful that notes be also given as an outline of the ppts.
2926,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"A bit too much material without going in depth anywhere. Also, code-grader sometimes behaves very strange"
2927,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some inconsistencies with the HW level (week 2 basically told you what to write) but very good lectures.
2928,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Keras exercises tough to get through based on provided information, but the content was superb as always"
2929,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really good course. Exercises are not always connected to the core of the deep learning problem though..
2930,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course is great , in the assignments it is  better to stick to single package and TF is preferable. "
2931,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Highly recommended course to understand the concept of speech recognition models, very real use cases."
2932,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great lectures, but ""fill-in-blanks-and-rewrite-math-formula-using-python"" assignments were annoying"
2933,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good course. Only, sometimes a bit more cryptic respect to the other ones in the specialization"
2934,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great lectures. The quality of exercises are also amazing, although some typos should be fixed asap. "
2935,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Some concepts need to be explained more detailed, otherwise I feel hard to keep up with the lecture"
2936,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great class. However, they are some typos/mistakes in the explanations of programming assignments."
2937,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,learned a lot but I wish their should be some sort of referencing material for further exploration 
2938,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Lecture content is pretty good. Exercises are much more finicky (less robust) than prior courses.
2939,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"more excercise should be there in last course, but overall content was very good"
2940,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The Attention model still needs more explanation. I haven't completely grasped attention models
2941,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,More errors than most in the projects. Likely due to the rush of getting this final course out
2942,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good course, informative and easy to follow. Only problem I had is with its auto grader."
2943,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really good course but compared to others optional assigments lack instructions in this one.
2944,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,My only  complain is Keras. A crash course/lecture on Keras would benefit this course a lot!
2945,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course is of high quality. However, it is not as good and clear as the previous courses."
2946,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Content needs a few improvements in quality but otherwise a valuable and instructive course.
2947,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent content, although the exercises - at this stage of specialization - should focus more on NN architecture, than on pure computational and matrix slicing tasks, imho."
2948,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Even though it has some flaws in audio clips and homeworks, programming assignments are fun to do. Great real world applications on this whole specialization is just perfect!"
2949,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The content was quite good as with previous courses in this specialization. Just dropping a star because week 1 material wasn't as clear to follow as the rest of the content.
2950,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Compared to the first two sections, I don't think this section is better than those. Anyway, I learnt some concepts about sequence models which I need to dive into in future"
2951,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A great course on NLP including Transformers. One star down for quite a brief introduction to transformers (I understand that time passes but you better update the course)
2952,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The videos are of high quality as always, while the programming exercises had some error in it. Compare with the previous few courses this one seems not polished so well."
2953,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I learned a lot, but it really felt like there could have been a whole other week's worth of material, especially talking about newer innovations like transformers, etc."
2954,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course and assignments helped me understand concepts in NLP. However, it is a little less comprehensive compared to the previous courses in the deep learning series"
2955,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Thank you Deep learning team for putting together this course. The course has really helped me understand the various possibilities with the knowledge of deep learning.
2956,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The first week was a bit too tough compared to the second and third. So, I felt it was a bit hurried. It could have been distributed into two separate weeks, perhaps. "
2957,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course was very useful. I would make the programming assignments for the first session a bit clear. Other than that, everything was easy to understand and clear."
2958,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good, but not as in depth as the other lecture series I found. It is faster paced and skips over much more of the detail at which they go into in the earlier modules. "
2959,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"If the programming exercises weren't plagued by some bugs, I would have given 5 star. It's a very complex subject matter, but Andrew takes you through it by the hand."
2960,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I feel week 2 and week 3 materials were covered a bit too quick. Would appreciate more explanation of the implementation details of beam search and activation model.
2961,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:, This last course (and especially the Week 4 material about transformers) feels much more rushed and less detailed than the previous courses in that specialization.
2962,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It was really helpful, every topics explained very well. However, in my standpoint of view, It did not cover some part in sequence learning, like graphical models. "
2963,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really nice course. Very informative. Unfortunately some programming exercises were a little buggy (the grader especially)...only a total reset of notebook helped!
2964,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, I learned a lot. The notebooks in courses 4 and 5 are a bit too long, they take a considerable amount of time, much more than the videos and quizes."
2965,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Wonderful, I just felt at times that the exercises were more similar to general programming than sequence modelling. Still, 10/10 course, would totally recommend."
2966,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,this course provide an adequate and what you want to know about recurrent neural network but it does require lots of programming skills to accomplish this course.
2967,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good course, but I needed more time than expected, especially for the exercises. For me, that was the most demanding course out of the 5 from that specialization."
2968,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"A lot of cool material covered from RNNs to LSTMs to Sequence Modeling.  But it is a lot to grasp and a lot to understand.  Overall, rigor and course is decent.  "
2969,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,programming assignments are not teaching us to code independently because of the helpers functions given in utils file. Feels like copy pasting the assignments
2970,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It is a really awesome course for those who want to get started with deep learning methods in NLP.
2971,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course is really good, one star less because it requires keras understanding to complete assignments properly. Including a basic intro of keras will help"
2972,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some techniques for keras need to be clarified. Generally a good course
2973,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I liked this particular set of lectures, too, now on to something new."
2974,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It required coding on keras and tensorflow not appropriate introduced.
2975,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The Course is great! But the programming assignments has too many bugs
2976,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"it's very difficult to submit last programming exercise ""trigger word"""
2977,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,More clarification on what we are doing in the programming exercises
2978,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great introduction to LSTMs, RNNs, GRUs, NLP and speech recognition."
2979,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great content but I felt it was bit rushed and squeezed in 3 weeks .
2979,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This is amazing course with much more interesting labs and practical examples
2980,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The quality was a bit down but still very worthwhile and interesting
2981,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great practical experience. Would have preferred a bit more theory.
2982,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,it covered a lot of interesting topics but it was a bit high level.
2983,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,great course to understand intuition of sequence modeling for NLP.
2984,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,课程虽然很短，只有三周的课程，但难度明显比之前四门课程要大，编程练习一共有7个，第一周的三个是最难的。但仍然是最优秀的深度学习课程。
2985,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Well explained, I feel like it could go a bit more in depth though"
2986,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Muy buen curso, resulta sumamente estimulante el ejemplo de woebot"
2987,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The good course as the theoretical basis for RNN and other models
2988,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Attention Models is not that clear. Everything else is excellent.
2989,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Excellent lectures. Some programming exercises need more clarity.
2990,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very hard, but not your fault, very good course ! Thank you !!!!"
2991,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is great but I was hoping to have a part about time series inside.
2992,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Few bugs with some jupyter notebook assignments, otherwise ... great course!"
2993,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It's pretty difficult for me, but I learn a lot of knowledge in this course."
2994,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great Course on giving an Introduction to RNN and basic NLP architectures !!
2995,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Please allow students to complete assignment from scratch. Without any help.
2996,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A lot of spoonfeeding. Stuck at optional exercises and a lot of wasted time.
2997,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,More exemple than Only NLP would have been nice ! But overall a great course
2998,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Exercises have less quality than the ones in previous courses.
2999,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,El curso esta muy bien peor deben añadir subtitulos en español
3000,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I think this course needs to have a continuation to go deeper.   
3001,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Grader was wrong sometimes. Typos everywhere in the notebooks.
3002,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"awesome, but need more animation for understand general works"
3003,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good course but can add more models to get a deep dive in NLP
3005,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This is a good course. However, this topic deserves much more detailed work."
3006,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The week4  on transformer is rushed and rough. Overall ,it's a good course."
3007,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The most difficult of the series. Yet I enjoyed learning so many new things
3008,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great Content with real-time example looking forward to doing more courses
3009,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Please remove repetitions from videos, really annoying thing. Great job :)"
3010,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Awesome notebooks to gain practical experience with deep learning systems.
3011,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This course is very interesting! Again! It requires basic Keras knowlegde.
3012,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Course is excellent. Assignment, however, could use some more refinement. "
3013,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It was really good, but I think I still didn't understand transformers!"
3014,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It would be good to extend some more detailed explanation in this course
3015,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,need some reviewing in the optional parts of the programming assignments
3016,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent course content, but poor maintenance of programming assignment"
3017,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Provides good exposure to sequence models for NLP and speech processing.
3018,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Instructions for labs are not clear enough, especially the layers part."
3019,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great exercises but videos were slightly rushed. Overall a good course.
3020,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good course. Feel a little bit rushed. Difficult to retain the concepts
3021,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The content is great, but the programming exercises are full of errors."
3022,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Muy difícil en comparación con los demás anteriores 
3023,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This is pretty involved - especially the last week
3024,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I would prefer to be the student of Sir Andrew Ng.
3025,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,这节课主要还是以入门为主，没有讲太多理论知识，序列模型部分讲解跳跃性较大，需要结合更多资料去仔细研究
3026,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Too much details! Too little time. More exercises! 
3027,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent content, the auto-grader not so awesome."
3028,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good course but can be too rushing sometimes.
3029,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course
3030,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A little too difficult to understand from scratch

3034,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Exercises are a bit tough and misunderstanding...
3035,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It will be nice if the videos are more detailed.
3036,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course was really interesting and well done
3037,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,One task has a bug and impossible to complete. 
3038,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,hope there are more projects about time series
3039,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The programming assingments have some errors.
3040,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Amazing Course with Awesome practice problems
3041,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,not as fun as CNN course but still so useful!
3042,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,a little bit too hard for the sequence model
3043,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I found this course bit difficult to grasp. 
3044,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,last lab with transformers had some errors
3045,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good but too long to follow with patience
3046,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good introduction to sequence models
3047,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,There is some noise in the video which is greatly disturbing. 
3048,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Maybe should give some advice about the future learning path.
3049,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course focus on natural processing and music examples. 
3050,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Much harder than previous ones, but also really interesting."
3051,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Would have liked an example outside of nlp, otherwise awsome"
3052,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,very important course concerning sequence in Deep learning.
3053,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Content is little less intuitive compared to other courses.
3054,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,codes are too long and it is taking time for codes to run 
3055,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeat but less than the first four courses.
3056,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The program in the exercise is a bit hard to understand.
3057,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good when it came. Annoying for the 2 month launch delay
3058,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,  i'd like to have applications more suited to real world  
3059,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,it would have been better if he used more visualization 
3060,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,There were a lot of problems with notebook task grader.
3061,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, but too many mistakes in the assignments."
3062,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,thank you for this. this give good knowaledge for  me
3063,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good content, it would have been good to do more keras"
3064,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really Nice course to get basic understanding of NLP. 
3065,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Trigger word detection: submit homework is so hard...
3066,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great insights, helpful notebooks, good explanations."
3067,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Again, programming assignment should work flawlessly! "
3068,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course to understand sequence models and NLP.
3069,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,un poco lentos los ejercicios y repetitivos comandos
3070,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good introduction to RNNs and their variations.
3071,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great professional-level instruction and exercises. 
3072,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Fine training, had some tchnicalities with the pythonn notebook which cost me loads of time."
3073,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,very good course for beginner to study.  But not enough clear for some concepts and models.
3074,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The practice was more guided than other courses. Felt that the Coursera team did all for me
3075,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Perfect course except there are are some mistake/ambiguous instruction in course assignment
3076,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course. Would like it if he kept his notation consistent with what is in the papers. 
3077,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"a lot to learn, content is well presented as usual. one of the assignments requires rework"
3078,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Seem like not as good as before course,Wait so much time but is not clear as course before"
3079,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,good course. Especially good in explaining the reasons and thoughts behind the algorithms
3080,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Trigger word detection assignment notebook has some bugs. Had a hard time submitting it
3081,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"There are many bugs in the assignment. Else, the material content and videos are great!"
3082,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really good but I guess you should teach more about how to apply all these models more. 
3083,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course was really straightforward, but the assignment hits was not really helpful."
3084,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Decent introduction but the material presented needs more time and training to absorb.
3085,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Too many errors are in assignments. Also, Some APIs from Keras are not well explained."
3086,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The assignment code instructions (specifically the code comments were very confusing).
3087,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"it was hard to catch up to all the new stuff, but as a first step, it's not that bad."
3088,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I feel the programming assignments should be revised. I have encountered many errors.
3089,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,There were a couple of problems with the grader that made this course less enjoyable. 
3090,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Missing the notes in between the videos like in the Intro to Machine Learning course
3091,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"some of the auto graders were a bit buggy, but overall loved the course and material"
3092,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Nice content. Spend some time on homework since I'm not very familiar with keras.
3093,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,coding style is out-of-date. Could the TA update the coding homework regularly?
3094,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I wish there was a more thorough tutorial on the Keras programming environment. 
3095,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Another awesome course. But I feel Word Embeddings part could have been better.
3096,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"A very good course in terms of application , again Dr. Ng did an excellent job "
3097,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great courses. Only 4 because too short !
3098,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,More In depth optional videos are needed.
3099,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I found it not that easy to comprehend.
3100,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The assignments were mostly copy paste. 
3101,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Not that interesting for me personally. 
3102,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,jupyter notebooks with a bunch of error
3103,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Fantastic lectures and helpful quizzes
3104,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Notebooks seemed to be made in a hurry
3105,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,good insights for RNN and time series
3106,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some of the tests were a bit too easy
3106,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, specially the programming assignments, they help much mor than the videos to undertand the core concepts."
3107,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,With effort easy to digest content
3108,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Need more inputs for keras library.
3109,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This sections was very interesting.
3110,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,an easy way to learn the conception
3111,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,my knowledge about DL is upgrading
3112,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Wish there was a tutorial on Keras
3113,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Not good as the previous courses.
3114,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Had some issues related with the jupyter notebook. Sometimes I had to restart the kernel to get the keras model working
3115,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I think a totally different course for NLP & CNN neeeds to be rolled out including their implementation in tensorflow.
3116,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Last notebook causing server problems. Large amount of material (theory) covered by compressed programming excercises.
3117,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course content and well explained by Andrew, looking forward to apply the learning to solve real world problems."
3118,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some items on the assignments were confusing or misleading. But the content of the course was rich and well explained.
3119,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent course. It would be better, however, if I could easily download the course slides and notes for quick recap."
3120,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really nice course but some programmation exercises isn't well built. (Compared to the other courses of this section)
3121,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It seemed a bit rushed in the end
3122,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good place to get back to basics
3123,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,not as good as the rest of the 5
3124,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good course to introduce to NLP
3125,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This was really a great course.
3126,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excelente curso, aprendí mucho."
3127,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,课程很棒，内容很多，但是作业编程的提示有些少，耽误了不少时间
3128,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Week 3 last assignment must be improved.I faced a lot of problems related to submission.All other aspects are amazing
3129,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent as usual, but not quite up to the usual standards, I felt some of the lectures and exercises were rushed..."
3130,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Cool exercises and good explanation, just too much focus on text mining and too little on actual RNN's if you ask me."
3131,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I finally have a superpower!!
3133,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Nice intro in recurrent neural networks.
3134,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I would have liked to have had an assignment covering beam search but overall it was excellent introduction to RNNs.
3135,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"overall it's great, but I think this course is a little bit high level on RNNs, I expected more content on GRU/LSTM."
3136,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course but it took them forever to finally open it.
3137,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Text Processing exercises should be added. Most of the examples are from image and speech. Overall good experience.  
3138,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great Course. But could improve on explanation part. And could teach more about architectures such as LSTM and GRU.
3139,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course ! However, there are several errors in the project assignments and it has been delayed for two months. "
3140,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I felt like important concepts were glossed over far more in this course than previous courses in this curriculum.
3141,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The update and correction of error should be more effectively and actively managed. That's the only error so far.
3142,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Everything is good, except the last week's material needs more explanation to avoid confusion and frustration."
3143,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The assignments should be after each topic or lecture because in the end is difficult to enhance the knowledge. 
3143,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,g
3144,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good course, but the errors in the last exercise was annoying and I missed a bit more about speech recognition.  "
3145,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Only complaint is that the exercises are too easy when all answers are practically given in the hints section.
3146,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Interesting topics but some fairly frustrating assignments. Happy to get a better understanding of NLP though! 
3148,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,..
3149,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"in comparison to the previous courses from this sequence, this one is even less structured - ptobably this is because even broader knowledge is tried to be shown in only 3 weeks, but i feel like a lot is skipped between videos (which are ok) and the tasks - in many assignment tasks in this course it is not very well explained what is meant to be done - i mean this especially in case of Keras objects. In many cases it is quite unclear how those classes are supposed to be handled in the context of our task. There are some hints but those are mostly links to documentation (btw, some of the links are no longer up to date), but it is often not too well explained which properties those objects have, what one can do etc. so one ends up with trying using those objects in different configuarations, then googling around, looking on the course forum for the right answer but it is very difficult to derive it. There should be more precise instructions regarding handling Keras objects - the examples in the documentation and in blogs are often much simpler than those from assignments so one ends up not knowing what is going on. In summary - there is a big jump and a big gap between the intuitions in videos (which btw are much more fuzzy than those in first cources in the specialization, the intuitions get more and more superfluous as one doesnt go into detail) and what is being done in the assignments. One thing i really liked about hte previous assignments was that when writing the code one could really know very well what is going on. And this is no longer the case in this course..."
3150,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"As we head to the last course in the specialization (and the last two courses are the ones that interested me), we have error after error in the assignments, including problems with the kernel that are not obvious until you've struggled with incoherent stack trace output for a while."
3151,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"It's helpful to have this course since there aren't enough beginner-oriented courses on these topics, especially ones that also get into actual equations like he does. However I think he doesn't provide enough explanations of complicated topics like GRU's and LSTM's. There are lots of confusing aspects of both such technologies, and he could afford to spend even more time in explanation than he does."
3152,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Unlike the other courses which Andrew Ng provides, this one contains many spelling mistakes in the programming assignment, the programming assignments are less structured and understandable (missing or wrong information in nearly every assignment) and an introduction to keras is missing. I found it great that the keras framework is an important component of this course, but unlike the tensorflow introduction it is missing here. It is frustrating, when you might have the right functions but no information how to input and determine the correct variables for the functions. Anyway I found the outline of the course very good as it gives a good overview of many methods and how they work. To my mind the consistency of the assignments and also the story telling needs to be improved to reach the level of other courses where Andrew is involved. It appeared more chaotic and the complexity of the algorithms is overwhelming, so a better introduction to how they work, might be appealing. In the end, I worked through it and I gained a basic understanding of keras and RNN algorithms. So it was definitely worth it."
3153,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"A nice course after all, but I expected something more. It is valuable if you know nothing about RNN and NLP, or if you know something and want to go a little deeper and work on some guided keras examples."
3154,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The subject matter was a good introduction to various RNN model types and concepts.  I have to dock a couple stars, however, as the course leans so heavily on Keras implementations during the assignments that it really should be listed as a firm requirement.  While I feel that I'm more experienced with both RNN models and the use of Keras now, it was a struggle with what felt like a lot of cargo culting for me to get through most of the assignments.  I don't consider the brief lesson on Keras at the end of the second course to be sufficient training, particularly if much time has passed between taking that course and this one.  A brief ""Lesson 0"" on Keras is sorely needed at the beginning of this course.  Otherwise, it should be explicitly and firmly communicated at the start that the programming assignments require a certain familiarity with the Keras framework.  Overall, I do highly recommend this course, but be forewarned about the need to be familiar with Keras before starting."
3155,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The material provides a strong overview of sample problems for which sequence models work well. However, the class doesn't give users the conceptual mastery needed to apply sequence models to new or related problems. The issue is that the motivation and concepts underlying new architectures aren't well-explained (they're often an afterthought at the end of a lecture). This approach to teaching feels backwards.
"
3156,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Toward the end of the specialization, there seemed to be a noticeable drop in both the quality of instruction and the programming assignments.  Course 5 on sequence models was much more ""hand wavy"" than Course 4 on convolution models.  At the end of Course 5, I'm still not sure if I learned anything meaningful other than filling in a few blank lines of code to complete the assignment.  There was much less intuition provided about the nature of recurrent nets, and then translating that to code was foggy.  More attention needs to be paid to how and what the framework is actually doing, not just giving hints at filling the blanks."
3157,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The best part of the course are ""intuitions"" presented by Prof. Ng. The worst parts are technical problems with Coursera infrastructure, and insufficient number of mentors available to offer suggestions. For example, in forums there are some doubts about the optional parts of assignments (bad formulas etc.), but these quite valid questions are just not addressed by anybody. I would also suggest adding a separate course on Keras as a part of the specialization, because the Keras introduction offered in a specialization is way too basic. This makes it quite difficult to go through the assignments for the sequential models. It would also be helpful to extend the last two courses to five weeks or so, to cover course material in more details."
3158,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The lectures are great, but the assignments are not: apart from the hours wasted restarting notebooks (!), I've found very frustrating to have to go between ""write `j = 0` on the next line"" to ""figure out Keras documentation by yourself, the grader will only tell you `it's wrong`"" (Keras having such a horrendous API, with many functions having 20+ arguments, and sometimes the course tells you to specify an argument that's not even in the documentation!).There is no balance between the two (you're mostly told ""write this, write that"", with no space for thinking as in the first course of the specialisation) and the assignments are primarily a chore you have to go through, even though you won't learn much, if anything, from them."
3159,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Really big struggle with dinos, versions of workbooks, and sometimes no logical way to explain why grader does not validate a working notebook. Pain, frustration, taking away time from proper learning."
3160,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This course provides great introduction to RNN and other sequence models and their application to popular fields such as NLP and audio processing. It does great job in providing the motivation and intuition behind the creation of such sequence models (e.g. LSTM, GRU, Word2vec, GloVe), however I feel that the theoretical explanations need to have more depth. During this course I had to refer to other websites to gain more technical understanding about LSTM and GRU. The programming exercises are nice, they cover many popular topics such as NLP, speech, and music processing, but I struggled when doing it in Keras. I wish some pointers were provided on where to learn it before doing the assignments."
3161,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Too many stability issues on the platform to get the notebook up and running.
3162,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The content is didatic, as well as the explanations, a reasonable course for a real beginner. However, the material is one of the worst I have seen: a lot of errors that are indicated with notes between the classes and MANY annotations and sketches from Andrew in the slides. It mixes up handwritten annotations with digital text, a complete mess. I had to edit the PDF in order to make something useful, even though a lot of information is either missing or floating somethere in the slide. Besides that, some videos are not edited properly: it is possible to experience many repetitions of the same phrase."
3163,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Although the course content is very useful, the hurry in which the course was put together does show. Video was clearly under-edited (as is apparent by Andrew repeating some statements in the expectation that the previous one would be edited out), and the auto graders caused me to waste many more hours than truly needed to get my assignments in a format that would be accepted. Finally, I was very disappointed at the fact that the specialization was launched and then the last course pulled out, so I had to pay two months even though I had budgeted my own time to finish it in one. "
3164,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Nice to learn how RNN's work. But too rough around the edges for a 5-star score. 
3165,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"To be completely honest, I loved Dr. Andrew's method of teaching. But the assignments just flew over my head because I didn't have enough hours of practice of Keras under my belt. I know Keras is there to make things easy but it's very difficult to just trying to pass the grader. To goal of assignments was fantastic, I mean, generating music, etc. sounds really amazing but I feel that if there was some more time given to make us better in Keras and other technicalities then I would've loved this course much more! "
3166,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Good but i expected more. The main thing i like about first 3 courses, they were really deep. In the last two courses we have skipped the backpropogation. Now this is something which you can keep optional. I like the way Andrew Ng teaches, going to the basics, and that is why I came here and paid 40 euros per month. Also, there are few stuff missing like Generative models, Adversarial networks, GAN and etc. It would be good if Andrew can have more courses related to this and deep (as it is deep learning :))"
3167,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"By far the most difficult of the 5 courses but giving it a lower review since the programming assignments are rushed through to finish 2-3 in 1 week which gets hectic & understanding of key concepts is lost. Also, it would help if more time is spent in the videos to explain the concept/model/algorithm used in the assignments since I close to understood nothing from the assignments in spite of completing them. Finally, the instructions too were not clear in the assignments."
3168,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Interesting and full of excellent lectures as always for Andrew Ng. The programming assignments quality was not as good as the other courses in the Deep Learning specialisation though. They drop straight into Keras with no information/introduction, use several complex model architectures without explanation,  in week 3 4 out of the 5 'your code' exercises were about audio sampling, not very relevant.  Again, excellent lectures, just not great programming examples."
3169,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Sorry to say they dropped the ball on this one. The last course of this specialisation has the most advanced topics thrown at you in just three weeks, and it's even more cookbook-like than in the previous courses. The material of this part of the specialisation would require a whole course in itself, perhaps for +10 weeks. Here, I found it is at best a guide for self-study, _if_ you have the time for that. Also, support in the forums was very minimal."
3170,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"There are some challenges with the videos eg. repetition, blank audio, variability in speaker's volume (difficult to hear).  In particular perhaps 'Bleu score' needs to be redone.  I did not enjoy the labs mostly because I don't have much interest in NLP BUT the 'emoji' and 'trigger word' labs were excellent!  Especially the 'trigger word' lab should be the standard for all labs, it was very well written: clear, good flow, no mistakes."
3171,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The scope of this course was highly relevant to me, but unfortunately many of the class materials were broken or otherwise incorrect, making some ungraded portions of the assignments difficult or impossible to achieve.  Activity on the discussion boards indicates many people have tripped over this for at least the better part of a year, but no corrections have been made.  This was quite frustrating and wasted a good amount of my time."
3172,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"I took this course after a long pause after I finished the first 3 courses. I would NOT recommend doing it that way. As a result, I felt rusty on some of the coding practices. "
3173,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This course was at a really high-level and barely scratches the surface of Sequence Models. Didn't really go into much detail behind any of the theory, and the programming assignments were mostly done for us, so you don't really end up learning much. You certainly won't be ready to have a job solving NLP problems after taking this course. If you want that, you're better off going through actual college courses online."
3174,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"First of all, the programming assignments are really copy-pastes. There is nothing really to storm your brain for. Second, many of the ideas presented in the video lectures are very brief and short, skipping the explanation parts. After taking this course, I now know the names of lots of algorithms and models, but that's all I know, only the names. To get broader knowledge on them, I have to look somewhere else now."
3175,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course content and Andrew Ng are great. The submission process of the assignments is absolutely dreadful. You might get 0 points for correct answers or not, depeding on...well, I have no idea on what. Maybe it's Jupyter Notebook, maybe it's Keras or maybe it's something else. But you must have good search engine skills, since you will most likely spend a lot of time in searching the discussion forum for answers."
3176,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"May be this is my observation but this is the 1st course where I am unable to understand most of the explanation by Andew Ng, and the course exercises are more like the python coding like slicing, dicing, filtering, and how come this course is same for last 3-4 years, not even objective questions, There has been a tremendous breakthrough in the field in last 3 years and the course content is still the same. "
3177,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,too much information for such a short course. We only get a very superficial understanding of concepts with very little practice to solidify our understanding. The assignments involve implementing very small parts of much bigger systems. I guess the course is ok to get a general idea of the concepts but for deeper understanding of the topics a longer course or multiple courses would be needed. 
3178,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This is a very interesting topic. However, I believe the course itself can be improved. I believe there can be more information about NLP and sequence models in lectures. It would be nice to add lectures with practical suggestions about training and tuning sequence models. There were lots of typos and mistakes in notebooks that were found by other fellow students and not addressed by mentors. "
3179,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course overall isn't as good as the previous 4 ones especially for the PA part, I can pass the grader even with wrong output. The PA improvement sometimes just create more discrepancy. The PA is just a walk through of how to building those basis models, but those little bugs will drain extra hours to figure out. I think this course is kind of a prototype one especially on PA part. "
3180,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Compared to the previous courses, this was a disappointment. There is not as much content as I expected and the homework exercises are not well prepared. If one spends more time with debugging than with ""learning concepts"" in a basic course like this, then something seems wrong. "
3181,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"That was tough, how the weights are stored and their dimensions inside the 'time steps' can be explained by adding one more video, btw the course is awesome if you want to learn the basics of sequence models, you should have completed the previous 4 courses before diving into this. I will always remain thankful to Andrew Ng for providing this type of platform."
3182,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Positives : Excellent lecture material. Assignments broadly are well structured. HIgh bar set by Andrew Ng.   Negatives: Assignments have too many errors and mistakes as of Jan 2019 (especially but not only in the optional / ungraded sections) for me to be confortable 100% recommending the course. Instructions for assignments are also not fully fleshed out. 
3183,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This course is good for introduction to sequence networks, but I felt this is not at par with the previous course 4 (CNN). This feels a bit hurriedly done, with many important things only just touched upon. This should have been a 4 week course like the previous module. Then due attention could have been given to the field of speech, audio, sequence domain."
3184,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course is generally good. However there are some issues with lecture videos editing (some sentences are said multiple times), and with activities (e.g. default settings hardcoded in one of notebooks, didn't let have output shown as reference, also in some cases automated grader has some assumptions, which need to be found using trial and error method)."
3185,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Great course, great activities and really good programming excercises. "
3186,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"I've got mixed feelings about the whole Specialization. Many very interesting topics, but on the other hands I don't feel like there's any takeaway knowledge for me. Until the very end I've been feeling completely lost in the exercices. I'm proud to have been able to hold on until the end but I'm not sure it's been an useful use of my time. "
3187,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Really interesting course with fascinating applications. However, in terms of difficulty, it is a significant step up from all the previous courses. A lot of time is spent figuring out the syntax even though the concepts are crystal clear. ( Probably as it is a collaboration with NVIDIA). The programming assignments could be improved. "
3188,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"It´s a fairly good course, with lots of cool topics covered on it.  My main complain would be that the subjects covered are dense enough to be arranged on a four or even five week course. Instead, for some reason, all the stuff has been squeezed within three weeks, which makes the lectures shallow and rather cryptic most of the time."
3189,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course was great, as ever. But some of the programming exercises were very frustrating. Oscillating from very easy to very difficult, with some unclear (and sometimes erroneous) instructions. I felt this was in sharp contrast with the previous 4 courses of this specialisation, for which the course and exercises were perfect."
3190,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,the course covered a lot of essentials and gave me a rough idea of how stuff NLP and sequence models work. Though at the same time the content often left me confused and overwhelmed. the Convolutional Networks course was far better. 
3191,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Great lectures, great teacher!"
3192,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The programming tasks were very simple. I doubt that you can really learn anything when you just need to copy the text from the task description and paste it. The content of the tasks was excellent, but the level of personal involvement was minimal."
3193,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The lectures were OK ... better LSTM tutorial by Chris
Olah"
3194,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"In my oppinion this course was too hard. I mean I could solve the assignments, but there was too much ""magic"" in those assignments. At least for me it was hard to develop enough intuition. But maybe its also due to the fact that I am more interessted in image based convnets where I have more background."
3195,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The course does not explain how to use Keras (it's assumed you've finished the previous course). What's more a lot of code parts is implemented in some difficult way (for loops instead of Python's builtins and idioms like any or list comprehensions). I'd love to see more materials on speech recognition.
3196,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"I guess as the subject matter becomes more complex, more training is required on the underlying frameworks being used- Keras, TensorFlow etc. Did not feel that sufficient time was spent on understanding the underlying frameworks. Also the TA work is of spotty quality. But I love the way Andrew teaches."
3197,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Very  helpful

3208,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,great course.
3209,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The Keras programming exercises are quite weak. Please re-think how to teach them more systematically. Currently it is quite a lot of hit and miss.
3210,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The lectures were great, but the programming assignments could have been structured better, especially the final assignment which drove me nuts."
3211,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,That was much harder than the previous courses of the specialization. However it felt like the videos are more hasty and less understoodable 
3212,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,There was a bug in a programming assignment notebook that took too much time to notice that i was doing ok but the expected ouptut was wrong
3213,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The programming  assignments required some extra effort to understand Keras which I thought may need an introduction video like tensorflow.
3214,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Several grader issues, only 3 weeks of work, and a lot of errors in the solutions... In addition, less content than in the other courses..."
3215,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The earlier courses were easy to understand, however, this was way too difficult. Andrew Ng did not make this easy like the other courses."
3216,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Compared with previous courses, this one seems to be rushed. The focus on applications seems to be much higher than the theoretic side."
3217,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Not as great as the other courses in the specialisation. The assignments can be a little off putting, but lectures are top class again."
3218,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Week 1 took double time to be completed. Times proposed for the assingnement are underestimated.

3231,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This course was good but in comparison to the other courses in the deeplearning course series, this course lacked adequate depth. "
3232,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course is a good course because the lecture Ng.W ,but the exercises is not easy for our beginers for such tools like kears."
3233,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The programming assignments in this course are difficult to implement. The detail descriptions are needed inside the notebooks. 
3234,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Good subject, but a lot of the course material (like lecture slides and problem sets) was either unavailable or out of date. "
3235,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The videos  are great - however it would be useful to provide some help on how to implement the concepts programatically.
3236,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The assignments need better instructions and there is a huge jump in complexity when going from lectures to assignments.
3237,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Not as good as the previous courses in the series, and some of the assignments where broken, and super hard to debug."
3238,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Only on NLP applications, it would have been great to apply GRU or LSTM on numerical data like finance for example."
3239,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The content covered is interesting, but I feel like the explanations are not as intuitive as the previous 4 courses"
3240,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Great Course
3241,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Fantastic!!!
3243,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Nice but little stressful. After completing 5 courses in a row, really feeling exhausted. Thanks for the good work. "
3244,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Quite a lot of bugs in the first week examples. It took me too much time until I browsed the discussion forums.
3245,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"the videos are programming assignments need some serious updates, too many typos and wrong information present"
3246,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I think you have to know more keras than is explained in the course. The keras documentation it is not enough.
3247,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The assignments were not good i think. Because they explained the consepts too long and complicated as like we've never seen these on lectures. I was waiting assignment  to require more insight about architecture and less python programming knowledge. This comment is for week1 assignments in special.
3248,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:, Programming assignments were not to the level of the prior courses in the series. Should have more illustration of using Keras/Tensorflow. Assignments either were too spoon fed or there was too little reference information whereas prior courses had a good balance. Many of the keras links are dead.   
3249,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"For me, there was a large gap on time between when course 4 and 5 were offered (months).  This unfortunately was enough for me to forget everything I learned about Keras.  "
3250,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Of the courses in the specialization, this one seemed the least organized and rushed. Some of the assignments had some annoying auto-grader quirks that made troubleshooting a pain. Overall it is still worthwhile, just be ready to search forums for help during the assignments."
3251,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Too many thing introduced in programming assignments without explanation. Why the high dropout values? Why sometimes one dropout layer, sometimes two? Many things are just given as a formula, and not explained in a way that would let me make my own network for my own problem."
3252,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The lessons are very good as always, but I'd like to be tested more in the programming exercises rather than literally being told what to do and then fill in missing parts of already completed code. Still super glad I took the specialisation, it has been extremely helpful. "
3253,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Had to rate this lower due to problem with the final assignment. Submission and saving situation was a nightmare, I had to redo my work several times. Please fix this, it's a real downer at the end of the course. Otherwise, content stellar as always."
3254,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course content is pretty good for breadth. However, it falls short in going into depth. Assignments need to be more open-ended and probably a bit more involved. It appears that we are cutting and pasting code that is already written in comments. "
3255,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This course presents an interesting review of several strategies that are part of the state of the art. However, it is impossible to assimilate how they work in the time devoted to each one. The ""fill in the blanks"" exercises do not help much."
3256,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This course gives a nice overview of sequence models. If it is true that I do not have an engineering background, I felt it got sometimes a little bit too abstract as compared to other courses of the specialisation. However, I recommend it."
3257,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"I would advise giving more tutorials about TensorFlow and Keras. Those are your main tools and eventually, in many cases we were only required to complete the gaps which don't give you a true understanding of how to use those frameworks."
3258,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The assignments are more like quests - most of the time is spent guessing what is required. The changes made require more programming skills rather than the understanding of ML principles.
3259,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The programming exercises can be better polished, there was quite a few errors that caused unnecessary confusion to the students. Many times, I felt like I was fighting with the Keras/Tensorflow API rather than solving a ML problem."
3260,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Courses had some issues with the grader, and there were some instances where the expected output in the assignment didn't match the actual output, despite it being correct."
3261,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Need more detailed explanation and programming assignments are way too easy.I would suggest to make advanced courses for people to improve their knowledge keeping all this courses also considering not all feel it very easy.
3262,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"this one was quite fast, should cover transformer in details and also other NLP models like BERT, GPT, MORE QUIZES should to be added based on tranformer acrchitechture, GRU and LSTM should me made short as LSTM is dead "
3263,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Every notebook was super well explained and made except the last one, which was very confusing, unfortunately. I did not enjoy doing that one :( Also, I think the transformers network were not deep explained as hoped. "
3264,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Video content is excellent but I am not very much happy with the assignment task. There should must also be some video content based on the assignment because the some codes some libraries are not taught.
3265,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"In comparison with other courses in this specialisation a lot of assignments were poor quality - vague descriptions and code logic (especially week1, asign 2 & 3)  or  just broken (last week3 assignment)"
3266,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"With respect to the others, this one seems to be prepared almost in a hurry and the learning curve is very steep and sometimes the programming assignment don't have a nice progression as the others. "
3267,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Videos were really informative and were equally interesting, but I believe that the programming assignments lacked a bit in clarity. The instructions were really unclear, it could have been better"
3268,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Quite a few bugs or abstractions in this course, in comparison to the others the projects feel a bit rushed and pushed together. Andrews's explanations and video lectures were still great though.  "
3269,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"this course is the most difficult in deep learning specification, but i think Andrew NG should design more homework for word embeddings and bidirectional rnn, i do not understand how it works yet"
3270,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course was great. However, coming from finance I was also hoping to see some examples which use time series so I can get a picture of how I can extend this knowledge to my specific domain. "
3271,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The module was really good in explaining the concepts, but there wasn't any deep dive on the equations and mathematics behind with the results of making the code assignment harder to achieve."
3272,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"An average course, it is detailed though some of the ending materials get too difficult for me to comprehend."
3273,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Assignments are very buggy and instructions misleading or incomplete. However the core material is excellent
3274,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Require a little depth, considering the complexibility. At least 4 Week course should be their instead of 3"
3275,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"There were a lot of issues with the notebook especially, for the week 3. The concepts were well explained. "
3276,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Would have required more of the ""intuition"" building material. Worst of the 5 course series, but still ok!"
3277,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Contents are way too easy and the video recordings are often a bit broken (repetition, blank audio, etc.)"
3278,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"incredibly boring. I mean at some task you literally asked to type in ""= False"" instead ""= None"". Really?"
3279,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,There are some mistakes need to be correct in the assignments. Still a lot of improvements can be made.
3280,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The assignments should be improved. More prep on Keras will help improve the efficiency of learning.
3281,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The practical tasks is bad. You are simply needed to rewrite formulas to python most of the time.
3282,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Very interesting topic but coding exercices and quizzes were a bit clunky and in need for ironing
3283,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The content is super interesting, but the assignments are more of the same 'fill in the blank'."
3284,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Put to much focus into getting the Keras code to work instead of truly learning the algorithms.
3285,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I found this very hard to follow along.  The concepts were too heavy and needs a slower pace.
3286,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Theory explained in a better way, but practicals could have been more involved and better."
3287,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Really Nice course. Could have been more fun if Keras and it's functioning had more focus.
3288,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Course is got but grader compilations are horrible spent more time on them than the course
3289,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Not as good as structured in explanation nor in programming assigments as the last ones.
3290,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This is only good enough, not good course. All previous ones were 5 stars, definitely!"
3291,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,the lab and programming is not as intuitive as the first two course in the specilism.
3292,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Overall a great class. I had some trouble understanding the programming assignments.
3293,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This felt the the least prepared and organized course of the series, unfortunately. "
3294,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,give projects that we can build from ground up without your inbuilt function.
3295,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Good theoretical overview - project just require you to fill in lines of code
3296,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Lectures on week4 are not complete as confirmed by mentor in the community
3297,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Course content is excellent, I would have given 5 stars, if the Programming assignments wouldn't have bugs. Fortunately people in forum help out with solving issues with assignments. I believe it's due to the short time frame the course is online and bugs get corrected."
3298,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"While this was the most relevant course for me, I missed how it was focused on ""helper functions"" instead of core RNN concepts. While I feel like I understand concepts like the Bleu score, I would definitely need to spend more time to fully grasp the RNN architecture."
3299,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good introduction into NLP and Sequence models in general. Too many things are done for you in order to fit this course into 4 weeks. I felt like I could not say that I built a system doing something. It was pre-built, while I just filled in some portions of code."
3300,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very nicely put together, takes a difficult topic and gives you just enough to get your head around it. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that a few times it was more difficult to figure out what the auto grader wanted than what was needed to complete the topic"
3301,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Would have been nice to get more extensive training in Keras en Tensorflow because programming excercies were somewhat too pre-compiled at times or other times difficult to code because of scarse knowledge of these packets. Otherwise great lecture material as usual
3302,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This was a great course and teaches you everything you need to know about RNN to get started doing your own research. With background in economics and finance it would have been nice to have one small assignment with time series data. Beside that, awesome course :)"
3303,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Thank you for this course. The content is very throughout and yet explained simply. I had a hard time with understanding the attention model, the explanation in the course is not enough, but after all, it is a complicated architecture. The labs help. Thank you."
3304,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The grader  has some bug.Even with correct output and with no bug in the code, it gives incorrect grading. Firstly the criteria to pass is so stiff(80% means to pass for every function).Secondly the bug in grading function grades incorrect for correct codes."
3305,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Andrew Ng does a great job in introducing Sequence models in this course. However, I have the feeling the theory behind all the concepts falls short. There are just too many different subtopics being covered instead of focusing on the main concepts of RNNs."
3306,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Compared to the previous 4 courses in this specialization, I felt this course a bit less on details. It may be just me not having the required level of understanding. It just felt like I could've used a little more details. Andrew is awesome as always."
3307,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The programming assignments were pretty hard this time. I think, Andrew should spend more time to explain the concepts in the video lectures. Took me a while to get this stuff since it is a little bit more abstract than the previous specializations.."
3308,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This last course of the series while still being excellent, it had a few minor issues in the assignments and was quite hard compared to the previous four. Nevertheless, I still learned a lot from it and I am really grateful for it being available."
3309,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very interesting and well taught course. The only disappointment is that it focuses almost completely on NLP. I would have much preferred working on other topics too, like for example time series with LSTM, which instead didn't even get mentioned."
3310,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,You should try to leave access to the previous code I wrote in the previous weeks or help out a little in week2 exercise I really struggled to get some of the code done because I didn't have access to my previous notebooks because you locked them
3311,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course is very interesting and well organized. Certainly the content is appropriate for the cost of the course. The only flaw, for me, is the lack of mathematical demonstrations, but I know it is impossible to cover this in a single course"
3312,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This course helps you build the basics for natural language processing using deep learning methods.
3313,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good continuation of RNNs covering theory and Python exercises using a few algorithms and uses cases. I would love to see more content and more interesting examples to implement in Python. Still, this is a nice introduction to sequence models"
3314,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Amazing information. My one complaint is that the assignments don't help you understand how to work with TensorFlow. Most of the time I would read the documentation on the functions and follow the syntax. Maybe it simply comes with practice.
3315,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I really liked it, however I don't feel like it really went into some of the more practicle issues with sequence models. I was left feeling like I wouldn't really know what to do in a situation where I had highly variable sequence lengths."
3316,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I preferred the first specialization courses. The explanations are not so clear as the explanations in the first courses. I will make the NLP specialization to have a better understanding. Anyway, I recommend the specialization. Very good!"
3317,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It is a very good course. Andrew Ng explanations are very clear and easy to understand with a lot of good examples. On the other hand there are some confusions or errors in the backpropagation part of the programming assignment about LSTM.
3318,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I am rating this course 4 because It doesn't give any guidance about future career paths and next things to learn. The explanations are very good. I understood complex things like GRU, LSTM, Bidirectional RNN, attention model very well."
3319,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"While a great introduction on RNNs, I felt there could be another week of lectures given the complexity of the algorithms being explained. Likewise, the programming exercises felt unpolished in some parts, like in the expected outputs."
3320,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good. To make it perfect, would have liked it for the Assignments to have less bugs (cf. LSTM backprop), and a longer course with extra weeks to present LSTM in the context of prediction (finance, weather, pattern recognition,...)"
3321,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course! only negative is that problems would really hold your hand.  I don't think there is any way I would pass a whiteboard test on any of this (then again a course to get me to that level would have to be double this length).
3322,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Little unsatisfied with the final part of the specialization.
3323,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,assignments are very hard and needs lots and lots of search 
3324,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Lack of Keras training made it often hard to do layer code. 
3325,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,This course needs more instruction on Keras.
3326,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Poor explanation for alot of things 
3327,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,boring and uninformative
3328,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Too difficult.
3328,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"The material really is great, but work needs to be done to improve the assignments, specifically submission and grading. On the last assignment I spent way more time troubleshooting the grader than the content of the assignment. It can be very frustrating to have to do this on a MOOC where no human support is available. It appears, specifically for this assignment based on discussion that this has been a problem for a very long time. "
3329,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Needs work.  
3330,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,I feel sad.
3331,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,sucks
3332,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"The good: Videos with a great overview of the theory, and some of the applications."
3333,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"The subject is fascinating, the instructor is undoubtly competent, but there is a strong feeling of lower quality with respect to the other 4 courses in the Spec (in particular the first 3). Many things in this course are only hinted to, without many details. Man things are just said but not really explained. Many recording errors as well. Maybe another week could have helped in having a little more depth in the subject"
3334,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Although the course lectures are great, as are all the lectures in this specialization, some of the assignments have rough edges that need to be smoothed out. It is particularly frustrating for those trying to work on the optional/ungraded programming assignment sections that have some incorrect comparison values, as much time will be wasted trying to figure out the source of the error."
3335,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Excellent lectures, terrible exercise material. E.g. ""You're implementing how to train a model! But we've done the actual training for you already! Your exercise is to add numbers A and B! Number A is 4. Number B is 11! Enter A + B in the box below!"" Also, someone did a search-and-replace and converted every sentence into an individual bullet point to reduce readability."
3336,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Unfortunately, this course is the less valuable in the specialization. Programming assignment very interesting but no introduction to Keras. To pass the assignments, forum support has been vital.  I also found lectures not clear even to the point that to catch some concepts you have to google around for more resources. Unfortunately, I could not suggest this course."
3337,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Compared to the other courses in the specialization, this appears to lack depth and clarity one could expect. LSTMs and GRUs are somewhat out-dated now, given the speed of innovation in the field, and Transformers are here to stay (for now). Unfortunately, Transformers are very poorly covered.  "
3338,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Getting the input parameters correct for the Keras assignments is on par with the satisfaction of dropping a ring, contact lens, or an expensive object into the sink, and spending an hour looking for it inside the disassembled pipes, through built up hair debris and molded dirt."
3339,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Grader is the worst and no help even in the forums inspite of getting the same output the grader is still failing and no one is telling why. Forced to drop out of this course now
3340,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,I would like to abandon this course and stop paying for a course I want to prepare better before maybe launching a new attempt..
3341,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Very bad experiance in the programming exercises. you will not able to run exercises and finish this course. A waste of money!!
3342,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,It's unreasonably a bad course!
3343,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,many ideas where not clear and more application use cases needed.
3344,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Overall a great course, thanks to Andrew NG for his great explanations. But a very bad support, I faced many issues in submitting the assignment due to technical issues (notebook not saving) but no dedicated resource to help me. I spend lot of time in resolving my self."
3345,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Can't even see the programming assignments without paying money. 
3346,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Not practical, Assignments can drain your energy."
3347,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,The explanation is not quite clear in this course
3348,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Glitchy Notebook, Minimal assistance at forums."
3349,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Feels again like authors tried to put everything into just a couple of weeks, thus the course turned out to be messy with lots of details hidden. Even though there was a lot to learn, I am still not sure if I understand correctly how to build a simple sequence model."
3350,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Really good to understand the basics, however, it doesn't use the latest TF2 and the exercises are either trivial because too much pre-worked, or too hard because it doesn't give the information required to succeed."
3351,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Programming assignment instructions are not well written (clear), and as a result it is easy to get stuck on something of little relevance to deep learning. Also, I would suggest that you make the lecture notes in written format available."
3352,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Assigments are pretty bad. I think in CNN and in RNN we should focus more on fundementals and build everything in numpy.  RNN course isnt for building intuintion(deep knowledge) you just scratch surface.
3353,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,The lectures cover the basic design of the models but don't help teaching you how to actually use them.  I learned more by reading blogs to get the programming assignments to work then this course.
3354,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Lectures/Videos were excellent, the assignments were very poor (loads of errors in the code not corrected over 7 months since the course went live)"
3355,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,The course videos were very lengthy and difficult to follow. Many topics discussed in course video were not part of programming assignment
3356,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Good introduction to the concepts. Really poor quality videos and exercises. Very frustrating when working on the assignments. 
3357,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,The videos were very helpful but the programming assignments were way too easy for this certificate to be worth much. 
3358,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Good lectures. Programming assignments are useless fill-in-the-blank exercises, you don't really learn much from them."
3359,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,5 stars for lecture videos. -1 star for the terrible transformer programming assignment which is simply frustrating.
3360,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,This one is way more difficult than the rest:(
3361,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Poor and unclear explaination, waste of time"
3362,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,very long with many unnecessary videos
3363,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Not practical and just complicated!
3364,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,can't submit the last assignment.
3366,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,The programming assignments really are like pulling teeth.  There's not really enough guidance leading up to them.
3367,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,The course videos and the programming assignments were lacking.  And there was no support in the forums.
3368,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Spent more time trying to work around a buggy grader than learning the underlying concepts.
3369,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Too hard to understand compared to the previous coursed in this specification.
3370,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Tough to comprehend. A little bit of written explanation might have helped.
3371,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Was very difficult. please add more expiation of mathematical equations.
3372,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,very basic ..would have wanted much advance level . 
3373,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Codes are not explained. Some codes files are given 
3374,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Works as a primer. Assignments aren't that great.
3375,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The learning embedding part is kindof confusing
3376,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Excellent content
3377,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Great course but has been dumbed down too much
3378,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Esperaba que los ejemplos fueran de otra forma
3379,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Should add some instruction videos of Keras
3380,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,does HW created/reviewed by different ones?
3381,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The assignments are not very satisfactory.. 
3382,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Not so well explained as the other courses
3383,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Too narrow focusing on applications in NLP
3384,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Programming exercises was very confusing.
3385,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Course should have have more descriptive
3386,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,it's not bad but it's also not perfect
3387,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Too many errors in the assignments
3388,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The mathematical part is little. 
3389,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,second week was hard to follow 
3390,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,So many errors need to fix.
3391,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,very tough for beginners
3392,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Keras is a ball-ache.
3393,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,too hard  
3394,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,good
3395,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,As a course i think this was way too fast and also way too assumptive. I wish the instructions were a bit slow and we broke down more into designing bilstms and how they work and more simple programming excercises. As a whole i think 1 full week of material is missing from this course which would concentrate on the basic RNN building for GRUs and LSTMs and then move on to applications. I usually do not review these courses and they are pretty standard but this course left me wanting and i will consult youtube and free repos to learn about it better. I did not gain confidence on my understanding.  Barely scraped through the assignments after group study and consulting people who know this stuff  (which defeats the purpose of this course i believe. It is to enable me with concrete understanding and ability to build these models . It shouldn't lead me to consult others and clear out doubts .)
3396,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"i really learned from this course some ideas on recurrent neural net, but the assignments of this course are not completely ready for learners and are full of mistakes which have existed for more than a year. those mistakes in the assignments mislead learners pretty much if they do not study some discussion threads of the forum. this course has the lowest quality among all of Dr. Andrew Ng's. before the updated versions, a learner had better have a look at the assignments discussion forum before starting the assignments."
3397,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Week 4 labs need to be better, the layers under the classes were confusing"
3398,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I found this course boring and also too many assignments in a single week.
3399,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Issues with assignments. Took more than 4 hours to figure out the problem.
3400,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,This was the least clear course among the others. The others were great!
3401,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Would like to learn a bit on how back-prop works when using attention. 
3402,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,fairly more complex and deeper as previous courses. Nice ex. however.
3403,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I feel this course is not as carefully designed as previous courses
3404,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,  Trigger word detection - v1.ipynb bug is annoying. Course is good.   
3405,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,ほぼ英語、プログラムの課題の問題を解決するのが非常に大変だった。bugも多いのでこなすのは苦労した。ビデオは相変わらず素晴らしい
3406,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Good Course but lectures and assignments could have been better. 
3407,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Should be five weeks instead of three. Dive deeper into Details
3408,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,lecture videos were good but in assignments let us code more.
3409,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,One of the weaker courses in the specialization. Felt rushed.
3410,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Assigments too complicate without a necessary guide and help.
3411,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Less clear instruction than other courses in specialization
3412,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Bugs in the programming assignments grading kills the flow
3413,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,This course is not satisfactory than the previous courses
3414,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,This course was comparatively boring than previous 4 ones
3415,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I felt the last week had too many things packed together

3811,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thank you, Professor Andrew Ng, for this nice and excellent specialization course with wonderful and constructive lecture videos.   "
3812,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Most fun and toughest course of the lot. Text data is always more complex, hard to analyse and model in comparison to image data."
3813,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"While the grader was a bit flaky (which was super frustrating), everything else was, as usual, top notch. Thanks Andrew and crew!"
3814,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"High quality lectures and interesting, relevant jupyter notebook exercises.  This is a great course at a very reasonable tuition. "
3815,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Another amazing course developed by Dr. Ng! This series of courses probably is the best deep learning training available on-line.

"
3823,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Many thanks Andrew Ng, your way of teaching things is so motivating and captures attention for sure. you're simply the best !!!"
3824,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Very detailed comments and carefully prepared contents. I feel my time spent on the course well worth it and thank you so much!
3825,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I understood LSTM concepts well thanks to the course. But explanation for equation is quick. I wanted to know the more details.
3826,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Really good explanation on even the smallest of things, that's what I like about Prof. Andrew, he never leaves a page unturned."
3827,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"jupyter notebook always can't submit, and can't save . I have spent more than 2 hours to submit a train ~ . But course is well."
3828,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Always can't submit assignment and there is no instruction about how to submit in json format.
3829,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,A must do for those who wish to kick start their career in Deep Learning. The concept of Attention Model with LSTMs is amazing.
3830,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Prof Ng did it again and taught an awesomely complicated topic awesomely well. I'm always sad whenever one of his courses ends.
3831,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Detailed in covered topics. Also interesting topics and the way they are brough in the material really triggered my couriosity
3832,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Things step up in terms of complexity with this course but it builds on everything you've learnt so far so it all makes sense!
3833,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"  O curso é muito didático e consegue passar os principais conhecimentos sobre Deep Learning de forma direta, concisa e precisa.  "
3834,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Andrew Ng is really best teacher in the world. In this course,  He has explained such complicated topics in so much easy ways."
3835,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very good content! I suggest using ""Ears: Bass Boost, EQ Any Audio!"" extension to dampen the painfully high audio frequencies."
3836,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"As the other course in this series, very informative. Learned a lot. Hope he can come up with others likes reinforced learning"
3837,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The course is brilliantly designed and gives you a balanced understanding of theoretical concepts and practical applications. 
3838,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course for NLP. It's difficult for me to finish this course, but I have made it!  Thank you Andrew, Thank you Coursera!"

3841,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,It was an exceptionally good course and the theory part of the course was really the best. I enjoyed completing it. Thank You
3842,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I didn't enjoy this one as the previous courses, maybe because I'm not interested in its topic, or I wanted just to finish it"
3843,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,El curso tiene un valor incalculable para mi formación profesional. El aprendizaje y el conocimiento adquirido es invaluable!
3844,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Best ever course I have learnt in Coursera. Thank you so much Andrew NG sir for explaining complex concepts in an easier way.
3845,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,soooo difficult...
3846,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,感觉没有前几次课程详细了，视频部分
3847,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good course
3848,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It was tough :)
3849,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very usefull!!!
3850,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,too long- good
3851,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,easy to learn
3852,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A bit cryptic
3853,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good material
3854,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,very useful
3855,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,a bit hard!
3856,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very Useful
3857,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,productive
3858,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Thank you.
3859,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Excellent
3860,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Average
3861,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great
3862,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great
3863,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,good
3864,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,nice
3865,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,good
3866,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good
3867,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good
3868,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good
3869,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,good
3870,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I gave 5 stars to other courses in this series but this one doesn't deserve 5 stars. There were many typos and bugs in the assignments compared to the other courses of the specialization.
3871,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Video Lectures were excellent.
3872,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The lectures are wonderful as usual but the practical assignments are so extraordinarily perplexing that it does not seem to improve the learner's comprehension by a significant extent.
3873,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Boring course:
3874,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The lectures were not as good as the previous andrew ng. courses, and the exercises were quite bad in all honesty."
3875,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Just one observation, the general view I have from this course is very positive but compared to the other courses the program exercises in this course are more difficult to understand. "
3876,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,A good introduction in Sequence models. Unluckily the programming assignments are more of a guess work then real knowledge as there are too few possibilities to check the own code. 
3877,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Despite being a great introduction to many NLP concepts, the programming exercises are a bit too much ""fill-in-the-blanks"" and not challenging enough. It is still a great course !"
3878,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Course contents were very good, but the assignments could have been improved a lot. Couldn't get much value out of the assignments rather than blindly following the instructions."
3879,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The class covered too less on the Sequence models such as LSTM and GRU. It has too much domain knowledge related videos.  Also, it does not have any video related to Time Series. "
3880,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The videos are good, however the assignments are too long with sooooo many text inside. You have to make it more efficient somehow."
3881,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Assignments in this course are relatively  less organized. You have to read a lot of description first and then code and have to go back/forth between code and description. 
3882,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I believe that the course needs more time allocated to the incremental teaching of this rather large subject area with varied applications. Just needs to be a better way.
3883,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course was especially interesting in week 2 and 3, but the assignments for week 1 were confusing and sometimes it was hard to follow where the logic was coming from."
3884,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,This was the most difficult to understand course in the whole specialization. Would have enjoyed more if the course material was a little more spaced and elaborated on.
3885,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Practical Assignments with Keras wasn't motivating. I spend more time to deep into the Keras rather than into the course topic. I prefer them to be using TF or Python.
3886,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The supports in keras programming was so poor, that I could not quite understand each step. And the server was horrible, always got 405 response when saving my codes."
3887,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,This course should be broken into 4 weeks and spend more time building skills with Keras.  The number of hours listed next to each assignment is unrealistically low.  
3888,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The lecture was great but the errors in the programming assignment (especially in formal-typed formulas) really wasted a lot of time and make me confusing at first.
3889,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The ideas presented here were clear, however I found the programming assignments non-intuitive and not practical. I spent on them way more time than I wish i had."
3890,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"I enjoyed all the courses, from my personal point of view this course was not that fun as the other courses. Except for the trigger assignment it was awesome!"

5567,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,非常好！
5568,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course has excellent content. Unfortunately there seems to be a slight drop in quality compared to the other courses in this series, with respect to the programming assignments. I didn't find them to be very clearly explained or illuminating. "
5569,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures were outstanding (as usual), but the programming assignments (except for the final Trigger Word assignment) were terrible.  I spent almost all my time trying to figure out Keras syntax, without ever having a Keras tutorial or anything.  If you are going to rely on Keras, you should probably add a tutorial or some references.  A lot of wasted time.  But other than that, this course was amazing."
5570,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good course. I liked the speech recognition part more. I found the assignments involving Keras code difficult to do in both RNN and CNN courses. Without the help of discussion forum i wouldn't have completed the Keras assignments. Thank you all the fellow students and mentors for your contributions to the discussion forum. Thank you so much Andrew and team for putting this awesome specialization :)
5571,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As the other courses in this series, this is definitely another great course, and explains to details the various sequence models. I gave it 4 stars because I believe it might need some improvements. Compared to the previous courses it felt a little rushed, and had too much new information and long programming exercises for a single week. Maybe it would have been better if it was 4 weeks instead of 3."
5572,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Always a great course but I would expect to have more lessons on how to use Keras and Tensor Flow API in a better way for who needs to use them in real NLP applications. I still have some doubts on how to use them correctly (for example the use of time distributed layer in the last exercise 'trigger word detection' that we didn't use in the architecture for the exercise about attention mechanism)
5573,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot. The descriptions of GRUs and LSTMs were a little scant, however, and I found myself rewatching the videos trying to get my head around them. The course could be improved by going into a little more detail about the different gates and what it means to train them, or what sorts of information or patterns might be relevant for the training of a gate."
5574,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Although I loved the course and learnt a lot, I don't feel as confident trying to implement some sort of sequence modelling in practice compared to the other courses. And yet I still got full marks for this section. I think the course could have been spread out to 4 weeks with a few extra examples (maybe some stock market prediction examples). Regardless, thank you so much for the teachings!"
5575,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I really enjoyed learning this course and gained a lot of knowledge from it. The only challenge that I found was some of the steps of the assignments were not clear. I could resolve them by checking the forum. I would also like to know more about document summary and document similarity, but there was not much content for it. Overall, thanks a lot for putting this valuable content together. "
5576,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great material and amazing Andrew Ng (5 stars) but very pure editoral review (videos with a lot of repeats of canceled phrases, pauses, quiz understanding, grader problems, very poorness of mentors support because they can do nothing to help, neither contact deeplearning.ai, in summary it's looks like alpha version of course not release and diserve 3 or even 2 stars), so in total 4 stars."
5577,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course is almost as good as the prior four, but some of the lectures lack detail, there are mistakes in some quizzes, and the programming assignments at times are crammed too full of information. You can end up passing through this class without really understanding what's going on, whereas the CNN class does a much better job of forcing you to understand things before you pass. "
5578,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Excellent lecture content.
5579,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures were great, making an advanced subject accessible. The course materials were mostly good -- the exception being the optional (non-graded) assignment in Week 1, which was not well-structured, and failed to reinforce the concepts it was intended to. There were challenges with connectivity to the Jupyter notebook server, which caused much frustration and wasted time."
5580,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Another great course by Prof. Ng. The reason for 4 stars is that I found the assignments to gloss over a lot of new Keras ideas (for Keras beginners) at the expense of spending more time on how the ideas were being implemented. I think the course should be spread out over more weeks, say 5, and spend the extra time going into more depth around the Keras model architectures."
5581,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,In the lecture videos there have been quite a few repetitions and in the programming exercises the necessary Keras background has not been delivered. For this I have to subtract one star.
5582,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course could have covered topics like time-series modeling for prediction (sales, demand, a machine failure in a factory, etc) that is much more applicable than some of the assignments proposed here (half of them seemed to be just for fun). Also, I am a little dissapointed that the course didn't cover chatbots, which is one of the most widely used applications for RNNs."
5583,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course was nice but more mathematics could be taught in the lectures, especially backpropagation in recurrent network. Also I feel there could be one more week in this course where recent models like Transformers and BERT can be taught. Overall a nice course to get familiar with Word Embeddings, LSTM, GRU, and some other topics like Translation and Speech Recognition."
5584,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The discussion felt really complicated at points. Also I was disappointed not to be able to complete the optional assignment for LSTM back propagation. Since it is ungraded, it would have been nice to at least see the correct implementation to learn from. Also there were several errors in the expected values or instructions in the assignments, that were really confusing."
5585,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The instructor Andrew Sir is excellent in conveying topics, but I just found the last part a bit dry compared to the previous 4. "
5586,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Ths course really shows cutting edge technology such as using deep networks consisting of LSTMs, GRUs etc.. I especially liked the audio trigger word recognition."
5587,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It has been quite a good course to explain the tedious concepts of RNN.
5588,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Concur with other reviewers: this class was good, covering a lot of interesting material and with well-structured quizzes & assignments. But the lectures seemed to skip past the sorts of in-depth explanations I wanted, instead just getting to the end point of ""this is what this looks like"". So good, but not quite as good as previous courses in the specialization."
5589,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course is great to get intuitive understanding of Word Embeddings, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs and Attention Models."
5590,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Really cool applications to work on, but the videos got a little too much into specific applications that may not be relevant most of the time.  It was all interesting, but it made this course a lot longer each week.  I could have done without a lot of the specifics of certain applications, just because it will be hard to apply/remember the concepts anyways."
5591,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I like the course for the very deep understanding of sequence models. But I really didn't like some practical tasks (especially closer to the end of course) as they are quite difficult to debug. It takes much time and doesn't get the feeling you understand how to handle with problems. Would love to have some insights about improving models debugging skill.
5592,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"All courses in this specialization are awesome. However, this last course feels a little rushed in comparison with the other 4 courses. While the first 3 courses raise your knowledge of ANN in preparation to the 4th one, it is a little more difficult to understand this 5th course. Likewise, completing the assignments is possible, but more frustrating."
5593,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,thank you
5594,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Excellent

5617,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Awesome!
5618,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Guys, just the truth: Content: Great. Mr. Ng: Great. Autograder: Complete and utter BS. If you rework the Infrastructure you will be big. If you further refuse to do so (literally thousands of complaints about the autograder in the forums -> nothing happens) you will not. Check out Scala courses approach with grading -> works like a charm. Cheers, JJ"
5619,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The content is generally great and well worth it. I wish they would fix 
some of the errors, especially in ungraded exercises. You end up wasting
 a lot of time because of them. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect is 
navigating to the Jupyter notebooks. I wish the links to the notebooks 
were on the same pages as the Submission and Discussion links."
5620,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I learned a lot. I would give 5 starts but the jupyter notebooks were very very buggy.  I spent half of my time on the homework going through the forums to find workarounds.  It took away from learning the material efficiently.  
5621,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is very interesting and it gives an insight into recurrent neural networks (RNN). The practical exercises are interesting but I found them in a bit raw state compared to the previous courses of the Deep Learning Specialization. Nevertheless I would still highly recommend to follow this course. Thanks a lot to organizers. 
5622,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Everything seems logical, except the programming assignments. Although I went through week 1 programming assignments only, I often had to face some problems with insufficient information. Lecture videos are easy to understand, but not all the details are explained. (This is the point where I need to find some information by hand.)"
5623,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As a non-computer science background student, the course was overwhelming, I got lost in the equations most of the time. Maybe a lower level course could be considered before starting this one. Nevertheless, this was an informative course about sequence models. Lots of quizzes and programming assignments reinforced my learning."
5624,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Videos are great; but as usual TP are too guided (hence boring) and do not use today frameworks (Pytorch, tensorflow 2). TPs should either be completely coded by candidates (only introduction + resfresh on concepts + objectives) with evaluation on final accuracy/f1 score <or> they should be no TPs at all and more MCQ tests "
5625,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Content her is great - the first week covers the basic RNN models in a very clear way and the assignments are interactive and interesting, building on the explanations in lectures. One downsides is that the production quality is poor and would benefit from some re-recording to remove bloopers and make it smoother to watch."
5626,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I wish it was a bit more interesting. It also kinda feels like Andrew has a bit of a problem himself in understanding the paradigms stated in this course, and that makes me feel somewhat confused as well. Would recommend for the math, the notations are weird and confusing sometimes but it is understandable for most parts."
5627,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This is a very interesting course with good explanations, which give a brief but sufficient introduction to sequential models like GRU and LSTM. One star is dropped because the CNN course (#4) is still better than this one in terms of explanations, while course #2 is better in terms of relevant material and pace (to me). "
5628,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Although I really really really love this series and although I always gave 5 stars, I think the quality of this last module is a lot less better than the previous ones. I think convolution was way more difficult but the explanation was awesome. Unfortunately, i think explanations in this module are a little sloppy. "
5629,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As usual, Andrew Ng's stellar talent as an educator shines through. Unfortunately, some of the video editing is a little scrappy, and the assignments could use some more polish. Especially in areas where they catch quirks in the grader. Luckily the forum support is excellent. This course is definitely worth doing. "
5630,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall nice course, learned a lot about NLP and Speech to text. Course is more oriented towards NLP applications, I was also hoping to learn more about time series analysis. Feel like the course could have been longer 4-5 weeks since RNN, LSTM and GRU is pretty long topic and 3 weeks seems to be too short for it. "
5631,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Recomiendo ampliamente este curso, te proporciona un claro entendimiento de los modelos secuenciales y recurrentes. Es excelente, aunque a diferencia de otros cursos de esta especialización no explicaron en detalle algunos aspectos de las RNN, me hubiese gustado que profundizaran un poco más en backpropagation."
5632,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The RNN, LSTM< and GRU were very good. But the Week 3seemed a bit abstract. More could have been covered in Audio, Attention."
5633,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This course provided a nice high level overview of RNN models and associated Keras implementations. The tricks and tips given were a useful addition to my ML arsenal. The only thing that I feel discredits this course is that the programming assignments are easy to gloss over and pass without much engagement. 
5634,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great introduction to RNNs and how to implement them in keras.  I suspect it is a relatively new course as there are still typos and a few errors in the assignments (otherwise I would have given 5 stars) but the forums help you to find your way around them and hopefully in future versions they will be fixed.
5635,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent lectures, some part was difficult and it took time for me to imagine the content of each parameter (e.g. when we talk about X, or a, or Waa what is the size of them and what do they represent). But in the exercises, it became more understandable. Exercises need previous knowledge of Keras and OOP."
5636,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It is a fabulous course content-wise. However, I personally find the programming exercises overly easy (the instructors already build the framework for you and the only thing you need to do is to fill in the blanks),  s.t. I'm still not able to build an RNN from scratch after completing all those exercises."
5637,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course is good. It introduces the concepts regarding recurrent models. I specially like the attention model videos. In general, the exercises are well written. However, I'm not very familiar with Keras and working on the Keras code really takes my time even I'm quite experienced with Tensorflow."
5638,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Professor Ng did a good job explaining sequence model and I finally understand the basic theories. However, there is room to improve especially on the Keras library part. I hope you can add some simple tutorial for that. Also, I still don't understand how to translate the architecture to Keras code."
5639,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This is a very well structured course. I initially started this course almost 10 months ago but got distracted and started to learn sequence models on my own. But, at the end end I resorted to this course again and got my basics cleared out. Thanks to deeplearning.ai team for designing this course!"
5640,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great explanations on the videos, and well designed programming exercises. However, the complexity of the programming tasks is not well dimensioned (1h - 1:30 h may be too little). Worse, some of the exercises are not well explained, with misleading information (e.g. about model tensor dimensions)."
5641,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"this is a well structured course, but it is not for beginners at all, andrew ng had put alot of his efforts in this. As a computer science major, I was able to grasp the maths concepts but for anyone comming from diffrent background its far from possible to understand all the theoratical concepts."
5642,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"There was not enough theory as the first three courses. Some explanations were superficial and difficult to understand. Maybe drawing the shape of the inputs, outputs, and other matrices in lectures would help to better visualize what's going on inside the networks. Overall, it was a great course."

5717,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Awesome
5718,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course covers one of the most influential developments in deep learning in recent times, and does so in a thorough way, introducing majority of the relevant mathematics and methods necessary to build a variety of sequence models."
5719,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is really good if you want to get a good understanding on the basics of deep learning. It would have been great if the course had more hand's on assignments than fill in the blanks kind of assignments in ipython notebook. 
5720,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I learnt a lot from this course and the whole specialization. I am grateful to the mentors and instructors. If coursera gives me opportunity I can also be mentor for the specialization to help the newcomers through the assignments. 
5721,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"During the first week, I think that a deeper explanation of the matrices' dimensions throughout the NNs should be given. Indeed, this would be helpful to understand some concepts."
5722,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course was good except first week. I did not learn as much as I would like from the programming exercises of week 1. It could be nice to have 4 weeks instead of 3 for this course. Taking more time to cover the week 1 material.
5723,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Everything is perfect, the teaching is excellent, the only problem is the jupyter notebook, its sometimes difficult to debug issues and takes a lot of time and is kind of vague as well in terms of application of the lectures."
5724,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Thanks to Andrew Ng and his amazing team, this course challenged my fundamental knowledge of Tensorflow and ML algorithms in the most useful way. However, I expected more applying libraries to design the NLP recent products. "
5725,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"some topics not explained in detail. Not enough examples to understand some models completely. As an example, I didn't fully understand what are the parameters for the models, their shapes, and how they are used in the model"
5726,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course! But I find the transformer assignment bit difficult. I think if the implementation would be covered in a 10-15 minutes video it would be a lot more easier to understand. Thank you for the great specialisation!
5727,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall it was pretty informational on introducing NLP to me. However, Keras was a little bit frustrating to learn at the beginning. I found out the forum was a very good resource to learn Keras syntax whenever I was stuck."
5728,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course! I do feel like I'm just scratching the surface of the types of applications that I can make. I think the coding segments still hold our hands a little too much, but you can't beat the clarity of the lectures. "
5729,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course lecture is grade but I hope the assignment is better in guiding structure, something the explanation is hard to follow, and the assignment should include the transfer learning instead of using the trained model."
5730,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This was hard to keep up with, maybe too hard. The assignments' difficulty also was on a different level then the lectures maybe there more time should be put into the lecture videos as it was the case for DNN and RNN."
5731,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The videos and programming exercises were very interesting and insightful. My only complain is some of notebooks for exercises include errors and it was just a time-wasting  task to find the ""trick"" to pass the grader."
5732,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The content is well captured and Andrew really helps build the required intuitions. But, the assignments are too guided. There is no room to struggle for solutions which often proves to be the main source of learning."
5733,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I think the transformer programming exercise of this fifth course is not as good as the others. The methods we must implement are not clearly explained and the research on these really took me a huge amount of time.
5734,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The exercises are too short and too basic for this course specifically. The task is a great learning experience but there is not much one would struggle with in terms of difficulty as there is too much spoon feeding.
5735,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great video lectures, but practical assignments are a pain due to awful auto-grading system and programming expirience in Jupyter in general. Most of the time you'll be searching for an error that isn't really there."
5736,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent course, excellent lecturer. Unfortunately some of the test data (week3/lab/trigger word detection/XY_dev/* CANNOT BE DOWNLOADED ... The programming lab sections are nice - sometime a bit too helped ... ;) "
5737,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It is better to talk more about bi-directional RNN and give assightment about it before week three and week four. Moreover, it is also better to give two more weeks to talk more about the material in week 3 and 4."
5738,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Programming exercises did show you quite a bit, but got complex enough that most of my time was spent reading and understanding the preamble than doing any programming. That being said it delivered on the promise."
5739,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Course content is really good! However, I found it quite difficult to truly understand deep learning algorithms. However, it provides good glimpse of of sequence models and intuitions behind various useful models."
5740,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course and material, Andrew NG really know who to explain difficult subjects in an intuitive way. However, the course seems that it still needs some work (there are some bugs in the lectures and assignments)"
5741,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures are suitable. Andrew, as always, is very clear and goes into necessary detail on each topic."
5742,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The NLP Section of this course is quite difficult to understand(The Notations are quite confusing as well as prior knowledge is required to understand) but other than that RNN, GRU, LTSM are explained clearly."
5743,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Much more challenging than the other courses in the DL specialisation. It forced me to delve a little deeper into the topic in order to overcome obstacles in the assignments. Content-wise, it's a great introduction to DL for NLP. Professor Ng's explanations are perfect."
5744,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course itself is cutting-edge, so a 5-star for this."
5745,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"In general, about all the specialization, I think that some of the programming assigments could be more didactive to understand the concepts of the courses and not to find what the code is doing in that specific task. For all the others aspects of the course I think it's perfect for a litlle bit more than an introduction."
5746,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It's a good intro to RNNs (LSTMS and GRU).  Very interesting use cases for RNNs. I feel that there could have been more room to try more programming exercises for different use cases & RNN architectures. Be aware that Keras is very sensitive to changes and you will find yourself reloading the jupyter kernels repeateadly when you get stuck. This is not a problem of the course itself but it is something that could end up wasting a lot of your time chasing problems when your code actually should work.  
5747,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lecture videos are great. Andrew is a great teacher in teaching concepts at the most intuitive level. By the time I finished the course, I had sufficient knowledge to be able to read and understand the paper. "
5748,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Another great course by Andrew Ng! This course is part of the CS230 class currently being taught at Stanford University. Only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that at this stage (April 2018), there are few knowledgeable mentors and virtually no Instructors present in the Forum. Course provides little introduction to the syntax of Keras, which makes for some problems implementing models. Therefore one might spend a lot of time spinning one's wheels until finding a way forward."
5749,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This last course is the most difficult challenge in the entire specialization, I personally have to watch back the video lectures many times. But I appreciate Andrew's efforts in transmitting knowledge in the most possibly understandable way.
In the assignment section, I found it necessary to have advanced experience in Python to be able to comprehend. Even if you have completed all the exercises, I believe most of you would only understand about 30-40% what you were doing."
5750,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As with all the 5 courses in the Deep Learning Specialization, the video lectures were amazing, thoughtfully designed (and separated) and gave an understandable overview of the content. As for the programming assignements, some lack a clear description of what is to do - that mostly concerns single steps withing a sub-task though. Tensorflow and Keras need a considerable amount of self-study next to the lectures to truly understand what you are doing there."
5751,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"NLP is definitely my favorite application of DL. This course was fun, although W4's assignment was quite confusing. Maybe it'd be nice to clarify that though the labs are ungraded, they'll help the learner deepen understanding of concepts and to explicitely recommend that they're completed before the assignment, so overall learning process becomes smoother. "
5752,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Theoretical knowledge gained during this course is good, for beginners in this area they learn what can be done and how. Only minus is practical assignements which are too straightforward, it's helpfull to have guide what to do, but maybe some assignement which doesn't have too much of a guide could be good (not necessarily the one which is graded but something which makes you to think a little bit more rather than follow the tips and writing Python code)."
5753,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I enjoyed this course very much. The videos were very informative covering a lot of ground in RNNs. I also enjoyed the assignments which covered both implementation of RNNs from scratch to get a good feel for it, and practical implementations. I was a bit disappointed about NLP section as it brushed over word embedding and left me without much understanding on how they are estimated. I would also like to have seen time-series covered in this course."
5754,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I loved all of the courses in the specialization. However, last two (sequence models and convolutional NNs) had in my opinion poor exercises, not well described, or emphasizing the parts which are not that important, omitting at the same time more important topics. For example the last exercise with spectogram was mainly focused on preparing the data rather than explaining/practicing algorithms. All in all, I gave 4/5 which is still very good grade. "
5755,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I dont understand why notebooks are become unavailable when I am working on it. It says method not allowed and then please login through www.coursera.org. Then I had to run all the cells again. I think this is because of the lack of resources like # of servers available. Other than that, like the content of the programming assignments. Especially the trigger word detection algorithm worked perfect with my own voice, that was satisfying of course."
5755,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It's a great course. The information and knowledge that you get about Sequence Models is fantastic as a primer. Andrew is an amazing teacher throughout the entire specialization altough I found the content of the videos in the Sequence Models slightly more rushed than the previous 4 courses...
5756,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This course is a great introduction to sequence models and a great way of finishing the specialization. All main areas were covered. It is a good entry point for those who want to keep improving their sequence-models skills. 
5757,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I got an overview of how people use this technology but the whole network architecture and especially dimensioning remains to be somewhat of a black art. 
5758,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Awesome course.  It feels like this one was more rushed than the others in the Specialization.  I am a bit concerned whether the ""Specialization"" has become a ""Survey"" of the course, and leans heavily on the assignments for teaching..but then, could do more for why some architectures are the way they are.  The assignments improved from being a spoon-feeding exercise. That's good.  But, on the other side, Keras documentation was confusing."
5759,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The 5th course materials were not as solid as the previous 4 courses. Mainly due to heavily use of Keras API and lack of Numpy implementation. There is nothing to complain about indeed as for the same amount of content the 5th courses had covered, implementing on Numpy will take way longer. Maybe adding more explanation on how the Keras API work will help a tons. Overall it is a very good course that I would recommend anyone to enroll."
5760,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent series of courses! Loved the lectures and thoroughly enjoyed the exercises! A big thanks to Andrew Ng and all the instructors and mentors. The forums provided useful hints on the couple of occasions I was stuck. While I would have initially suggested providing more info on Keras APIs, in hindsite the additional time spent in searching Keras documentation was useful arriving at better understanding of the infrastructure."
5761,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The Literature for RNN's was not motivating enough compared to Convolutional Networks and the previous courses. However, Andrew did concentrate on the important aspects which would help us in building RNN ourselves. I did feel the assignments were not as elaborative and extensive as the CNN's but I understand the idea behind it (being just to make users aware of the skeleton of the model instead of doing everything from scratch). "
5762,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The theory was absolutely interesting and an eye-opener. The programming exercises were hard to make because of the keras/tensorflow knowledge and I actually ended up just fill-in in things, as were given in the examples, without really knowing what I was doing. Time for a Tensorflow course."
5763,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Poderia dar um pouco mais de instruções na hora de usar as funções do Keras. Ficou um pouco confuso. 
5764,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Though the lessons are interesting and mathematically demanding, I felt that it was a good time spent learning these concepts. Overall I feel that the 3 weeks could be split into 4 weeks and learning could have been much smoother by adding some more lessons to address the contents of Week 2. "
5765,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I Love it! every single part of the course!
5766,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Nice content, but the assignments are too easy and only demonstrate the pipeline instead of providing hand-on experience in picking the network and training with GPU. Also, there are some grader problems which has wasted my time to make my code pass the grader even if the answer is correct."
5767,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The homework grading methods need improvement. I got the right model and get the right results, but still have to spend tons of time to make the submission pass the grading system. It is a waste of time for future learning.  You may want to train a DL model to solve this grading problem :). "
5768,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great explanation of theory (RNNs etc.) and easy to follow course structure. The programming exercises are disappointing though: They mostly consist of mindlessly copying Keras functions without an understandable (!) explanation. Many provided links to the Keras documentation are outdated.
5769,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Assignment for week 4 offered little instruction. The exercises for implementing the 
5770,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This one is much better then the previous one - Coursera team definitely made their homework. However some theoretical blank-spaces are still left. For instance - nothing is said about how recursive gates are being updated during BPTT backward pass. For someone who has the some experience and read some other sources that is not a big deal, but for a complete first-timer who pays attention and uses his brain - this is a pure flaw."
5771,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very interesting application of deep learning. Gives a good overview. Assignments are fun, yet it's too easy to complete the assignments without understanding the big picture. I found the ""attitude"" assignment in week 3 a bit difficult to grasp however. Particularly liked the dinosaur names, emojify, the humour and positivity in the course: mentioning gender/racial bias, encouraging people to do good with their skills. Namaste!"
5772,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good overall. Andrew Ng explains the material clearly and accessibly.
5773,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I thought the course and the specialization was great for people who want to get into the details of deep learning. Although I enjoyed learning about all the details, I wish there was a separate course specifically for Keras and TensorFlow. In practice, we will rarely have to implement the models from scratch, and having a better understanding of Keras and TensorFlow would be more helpful in terms of career prospects. "
5774,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Andrew has a very good video-lecture style.  
5775,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Presentation is amazing... Professor Ng always does fantastic job of communicating the material in a clear and easily understood way.
5777,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Obviously, The professor and TAs have put a lot of time for preparation of this course, and I really appreciate it. However, the hws of the course is too much focused on language translation. They could put another examples, say business data, to represent other applications of RNN/LSTMs."
5778,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course should provide more instruction on the Keras and Tensorflow, since the notebook is largely dependent on the knowledge of these frameworks. Moreover, the logic of programming is not so well-organized: I personally prefer to have my own logic instead of modules got implemented :)"
5779,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Really interesting course with overview about sequence models and what can you do with them. Lectures from prof. NG are amazing as usual. The only thing I was missing was maybe more tutorials on Keras LSTM usage. The exercises on LSTM were quite confusing, especially using shared layers.  "
5780,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very Important !!!
5781,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I am overwhelmed by too much material. Additionally Tensorflow and Keras syntax is not very elegant or coherent as they are such high-level languages. I learnt a lot at a high-level overview in this course, but my fundamental understanding was consolidated in the previous 4 courses."
5782,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Finally, the last course was completed. For me, this course is very difficult, because the content of the course is somewhat obscure and difficult to understand. But I learned some basic knowledge about Natural Language Processing and Speech Recognition through this course. Thanks!"
5783,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Insightful course though I wish the course would be longer and more spelled out, since sequence models are quite complicated and harder to understand. Instructions on programming exercises are also sometimes pretty unclear, especially in later weeks. Still, overall a great course."
5784,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This is my third course in Deep Learning, the contents and pace of learning are great, they provide a good level of understanding in the subject. The notebooks have bugs and I wasted a lot of times making them work, thus they could be improved to use that time actually learning."
5785,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The concepts presented in this course were advanced enough. Yet, the assignments did not require much effort and thinking, which in my opinion is hurting the learning process. If students do not struggle enough with the course, they tend to forget the material they have learned."
5786,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very interesting courses. I take this as a basis for future applications. I only regret that the exercises are too guided. I can't pretend to be able to accomplish a project in machine learning :-(
5787,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great content, assignments are fun and reasonably instructive (although they contain the occasional error and the video editing for the lecture content seems a bit rushed at times). I would recommend this course as an introduction to recurrent neural networks and related ideas."
5788,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Course is about recurrent neural networks, natural language processing and basics of speech recognition. Valuable content and great delivery by the author expect the final week where it's difficult to understand the transformers network and the related programming assignment."
5789,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very informative and well taught course on sequence models. The amount of content and pacing was just right as not to be overwhelmingly complicated. There are a few bugs here and there in the programming exercise which can lead to a lot of headaches but overall a good course!
5790,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, with interesting programming assignments, but still, I couldn't catch intuition about GRU and LSTM nature (I understood its pupuse and equations but couldn't get why exactly THAT combination of equations is necessary to allow RNN learn long term dependencies)."
5791,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Week 3: quite a complected network was used for trigger word detection; however, it is not clear why exactly this architecture was used; specific order of dropout, batchnorm and GRU seems to be a pure magic; at least, a few words why this combination is picked are needed."
5792,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"very good hands-on course. Yet I wished in the programming assignments, it was stated clearer, whether the implemented code is for understanding purposes only (and hence being the reason to be implemented) or is still mandatory even when working within a library (keras). "
5793,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The time allocated to some of the assigments should be increased. The estimated time in many cases seems to assume that one is aware of Keras and Tensorflow
5794,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"To the point ; sometimes it would be nice to explain the research papers more in depth, and link other courses to have more formal mathematical explanations"
5795,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Give us one more week to learn RNN for time series in economics, finance, etc!"
5796,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Well-made course, but unfortunately there are tons of mistakes in the programming assignments - in the comments, formulas, even in the prepared code pieces. "
5797,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The best course in the Deep Learning Specialization. Really good and well explained. There are some problems and mistakes in the problem assignments though.
5798,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Somes basics, tiny bit of theory, a bit of keras and insights for practical tasks. Some strage errors in notebook exercises makes it 2x time longer though."
5799,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course. The only tiny flaw is that the introduction to Tensorflow and Keras was a bit shallow so that I struggled a bit with programming these parts.
5799,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Week1 lessons are a little complex than the previous classes and there are gaps between ground-up python version and keras version of LSTM model. Keras will need to be taught a bit more in detail to follow up. 
5800,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Instructive course with useful concepts. However, there were many more mistakes in the notebooks compared to the previous 4 courses in the specialization."
5801,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Awesome introduction, but feels like Andrew is a little bit rushing since it is the last course in the series, I dont feel it is as clear as other courses"
5802,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The CNN course was better in this series of courses. This course is also good, but more content could be provided. Still the best small course out there."
5803,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Faced issues regarding assignment submissions. Otherwise, the course is perfect. Would upgrade my review to 5 stars if this issue seems to be fixed later"
5804,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Es buen, algo extenso, pero suficiente para avanzar.  Algo importante es actualizar los cursos con los nuevos algoritmos, al menos uno, por ejemplo BERT."
5805,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course is quite challenging, but at least the concepts were well explained. Wished that Andrew and his team could conduct a crash course on Keras :)"
5806,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"A great intro to RNN, LSTM, GRU, Activation. Programming assignments are rather messy though (unlike those in the other courses of this specialisation)."
5807,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, I like the practical application and assignments discussed in this course , wish latest research papers were also discussed in the course,"
5808,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course introduces mainly about RNN, GRU and LSTM. Great assignments. 1 score off for the in-correction in assignments. 4.5 scores from me actually."
5809,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great lectures, really well explained, assignments could request more from the trainee to devise the logic instead of having it already defined for him."
5810,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good course, however I would like to have more Transformers application in the last part as well as some information regarding the fine tuning of them."
5811,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This is by far the hardest course in the specialization. But it was explained well. My only complain is there were errors in the first programming exercise. All in all, I learned a lot in this specialization."
5812,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great content! I really love Andrew's teaching style. (1 star deduction for some programming assignments where I spent time debugging but it turned out that the point deduction was due to the grading system.)
5813,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Overall course content is great but I feel like improvements can be made on the lab exercises to give students concrete understanding along with hands-on experience. A great job by the deeplearning.AI team.
5814,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The programming exercises are a little heavy in this course where we need to load and re-load for them to give correct output even if the code had been correct all throughout. Otherwise, the course is great."
5815,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"4 stars and not 5 stars because the course is shorter than the others and it feels like an exemple in classical forecasting is lacking (sales, time series...). "
5816,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It's an excellent course! I will give it 5 stars if it could offer more interesting and meaningful assignments(Not offend, but it a little too easy and the assignments are not very related to the real work). "
5817,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course should contain more explanation about natural language processing like tf-idf,lemmatization,stemming,dialog flow. Although i got a good explanation of working of RNNs,LSTM and machine translation"
5818,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course to start off with sequence model. The programming exercises were in depth and deliver a great learning experience. Would love to see more of sequence literature in the course's future versions.
5819,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Thank you very much for all the work you have done. I have learned so many things... I will try to use this stuff  in the coming months. Yours, Thierry"
5820,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course is really good, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn the subject, but it lacks support from the staff in the discussion forums."
5821,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good course. Some editing issues in the lectures and small issues with the programming exercises (outdated Keras instructions and documentation). 
5822,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures are excellent. The assignments are an extremely valid trace of significant deep learning application, while they lack a bit of challenge."
5823,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As always, this course is great. however, for some reason this course is much more difficult then the others, and i feel as if it is packed too much.  "
5824,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Really good course, like the others. A bit too black box in some of the programming exercises, so I expect to struggle when developing my own models."
5825,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The videos are really informative and well structured. However, the exams felt like Keras tests. A detailed Keras tutorial would have been helpful. "
5827,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Again a brilliant course from Andrew NG, but though and dense this time. In order to grasp the meanings videos and lectures need to be revised a few times. Also, get some extra info elsewhere does not hurt."
5828,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent presentation, and interesting assignments. One star dropped because a couple of technical issues with the assignment material (typos in the mathematical formulas / expected results here and there)"
5829,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The contents are great as always.  However, the server is not reliable.  Once, the grader is down and you can't submit homework.  For another time, the connection is lost and all the changes made are lost."
5830,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, but I felt the gap between the very high level lectures and very low level labs was a bit too wide. I had some issues with the autograder and losing progress in the notebook between sessions."
5831,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course. The only frustrating part are the programming assignments as it is very cumbersome to have to go thru the discussion forums to resolve issues. Tough to find helpful insights thru the forums. 
5832,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Andrew Ng is perfect like everytime. I didn't have any issue with programming exercises unlike other comment so probably it fixed. I wish course  to be more detailed especially training word vectors part. 
5833,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very well produced and explained.  In my case, the nature of the Sequence Model makes understanding the concepts and finishing the assignment more challenging than other segments of the specialization."
5834,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is very short when compared to first 3 courses in this series. It would have been better if more explanation and shorter assignments were provided in the initial weeks and increase the pace.
5835,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The previous courses raised the bar and expectations. The assignments for Week 1 and Week 2 were a bit unclear. Lectures for Week 1 and Week 2 can be improved as well. Besides, this is a great course!"
5836,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The material itself is very informative and useful. But I have to give ""just"" 4 stars because, the training videos have to be edited better and there were a few mistakes in the programing exercises."
5836,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Parts of the critical details are a little vague, but the intuition and experience provided are extremely valuable and useful for me!"
5837,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Please work on getting the notebooks to work properly. Also very bummed that after canceling my subscription, I won't have access to my homeworks. You guys should give us lifelong access - we paid!"
5838,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A general overview into the power of sequence models. There is no rigorous mathematics here so most of what students can learn is high-level implementation and intuition about the various models. 
5839,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Es el mas complejo de todos los cursos de la certificación, faltna alguna traducciones que lo hacen  un poco mas dificil de entender algunos conceptos, pero leyendo y probando se logra entender. "
5840,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great  final module !
5841,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"An appropriate course for getting started with Recurrent Neural Networks and its very applications in the domains of speech recognition, sentiment classification, neural machine translation etc"
5842,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall teaching of Andrew Ng sir is Fabulous, but it was very hectic with the technical problem of the last assignment and I would like to thank Andrew Ng sir for the teaching me this course"
5843,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Found it a bit harder to follow along. I believe this topic needs a more indepth treatment and possibly more time (4 weeks at least). 
5844,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"
Really good course, but the audio quality (repetitions, periods of silence etc) was decreasing over the course of the specialization

"
5845,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The exercises are somewhat tough for this exercise I think the time should be extended by one week extra to complete the assignment. 
5846,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The material is great. On the other hand, if we could get a lecture on Keras, it would help us work on the programming assignments."
5847,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent content, although the exercises - at this stage of specialization - should focus more on NN architecture, than on pure computational and matrix slicing tasks, imho."
5848,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Besides some technical difficulties in the notebook (and some minor details in the video quality) the course was very informative!
5849,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Overall well executed course and sequence. You'll pick up RNN essentials and use Keras/Tensorflow to work through simple examples.
5850,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Video editing is bad and assignments have lots of inconsistent wording and bugs, apart from that knowledge wise really good course"
5851,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Course was very good and I learned a lot. I think assignments can be more open ended to encourage students to try multiple ideas.
5852,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Assignments were confusing in when they seemed to work but graded wrong and sometimes they were graded correct but didn't work.
5853,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Some programming assignments have few errors in them (wrong equations, wrong expected output etc.) which need to be corrected."
5854,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This course is very useful!!! I want to give you 5 stars but there are a lot of bugs on your practice course. Please check it.
5855,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course. My only complaint is about the assignments. The weren't as polished as in other courses in this specialization.
5856,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"There were some puzzling parts to the programming assignments (number of trainable parameters), but overall very good course."
5857,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Even though it has some flaws in audio clips and homeworks, programming assignments are fun to do. Great real world applications on this whole specialization is just perfect!"
5858,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The content was quite good as with previous courses in this specialization. Just dropping a star because week 1 material wasn't as clear to follow as the rest of the content.
5859,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Compared to the first two sections, I don't think this section is better than those. Anyway, I learnt some concepts about sequence models which I need to dive into in future"
5860,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A great course on NLP including Transformers. One star down for quite a brief introduction to transformers (I understand that time passes but you better update the course)
5861,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The videos are of high quality as always, while the programming exercises had some error in it. Compare with the previous few courses this one seems not polished so well."
5862,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I learned a lot, but it really felt like there could have been a whole other week's worth of material, especially talking about newer innovations like transformers, etc."
5863,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course and assignments helped me understand concepts in NLP. However, it is a little less comprehensive compared to the previous courses in the deep learning series"
5864,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Thank you Deep learning team for putting together this course. The course has really helped me understand the various possibilities with the knowledge of deep learning.
5865,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The first week was a bit too tough compared to the second and third. So, I felt it was a bit hurried. It could have been distributed into two separate weeks, perhaps. "
5866,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course was very useful. I would make the programming assignments for the first session a bit clear. Other than that, everything was easy to understand and clear."
5867,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"this course seemed glitchy compared to previous courses. some multi-answer quiz questions would only allow one answer, etc."
5868,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent course overall, but the programming assignments left me feeling a it unprepared considering the previous lectures."
5869,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very nicely explained and grateful for that. However, The assignements are little hard to follow from the previous courses."
5870,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I am grateful for this course, it literally is redefining my career and what I want to do. Thanks for the excellent course!"
5871,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,thank you so much for the material. pls do something with assignment of week4 to make it more constructive than confusive.
5872,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Some excercizes were subpar, and some were not interesting, but all in all very good course in which one can learn so much"
5873,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"assignments were good if there is any direct interaction, taking input from the writer itself will be too much excitement."
5874,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good, but not as in depth as the other lecture series I found. It is faster paced and skips over much more of the detail at which they go into in the earlier modules. "
5875,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"If the programming exercises weren't plagued by some bugs, I would have given 5 star. It's a very complex subject matter, but Andrew takes you through it by the hand."
5876,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I feel week 2 and week 3 materials were covered a bit too quick. Would appreciate more explanation of the implementation details of beam search and activation model.
5877,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:, This last course (and especially the Week 4 material about transformers) feels much more rushed and less detailed than the previous courses in that specialization.
5878,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A little much in not so much amount of time. Could have had more videos. Otherwise great course and great course material
5879,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good introduction to RNNs, text/music generation, NLP etc."
5880,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Found the embeddings lectures & transformers lectures to be a bit confusing and could give a little bit more explanation
5881,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It was really helpful, every topics explained very well. However, in my standpoint of view, It did not cover some part in sequence learning, like graphical models. "
5882,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really nice course. Very informative. Unfortunately some programming exercises were a little buggy (the grader especially)...only a total reset of notebook helped!
5883,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, I learned a lot. The notebooks in courses 4 and 5 are a bit too long, they take a considerable amount of time, much more than the videos and quizes."
5884,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Wonderful, I just felt at times that the exercises were more similar to general programming than sequence modelling. Still, 10/10 course, would totally recommend."
5885,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,this course provide an adequate and what you want to know about recurrent neural network but it does require lots of programming skills to accomplish this course.
5886,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good course, but I needed more time than expected, especially for the exercises. For me, that was the most demanding course out of the 5 from that specialization."
5887,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The low-level framework, such as torch, should be used in the assignment. keras is complicated to understand for newbie."
5889,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"A lot of cool material covered from RNNs to LSTMs to Sequence Modeling.  But it is a lot to grasp and a lot to understand.  Overall, rigor and course is decent.  "
5890,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,programming assignments are not teaching us to code independently because of the helpers functions given in utils file. Feels like copy pasting the assignments
5891,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It is a really awesome course for those who want to get started with deep learning methods in NLP.
5892,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course is really good, one star less because it requires keras understanding to complete assignments properly. Including a basic intro of keras will help"
5893,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Course content is excellent, I would have given 5 stars, if the Programming assignments wouldn't have bugs. Fortunately people in forum help out with solving issues with assignments. I believe it's due to the short time frame the course is online and bugs get corrected."
5894,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"While this was the most relevant course for me, I missed how it was focused on ""helper functions"" instead of core RNN concepts. While I feel like I understand concepts like the Bleu score, I would definitely need to spend more time to fully grasp the RNN architecture."
5895,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good introduction into NLP and Sequence models in general. Too many things are done for you in order to fit this course into 4 weeks. I felt like I could not say that I built a system doing something. It was pre-built, while I just filled in some portions of code."
5896,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very nicely put together, takes a difficult topic and gives you just enough to get your head around it. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that a few times it was more difficult to figure out what the auto grader wanted than what was needed to complete the topic"
5897,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Would have been nice to get more extensive training in Keras en Tensorflow because programming excercies were somewhat too pre-compiled at times or other times difficult to code because of scarse knowledge of these packets. Otherwise great lecture material as usual
5898,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This was a great course and teaches you everything you need to know about RNN to get started doing your own research. With background in economics and finance it would have been nice to have one small assignment with time series data. Beside that, awesome course :)"
5899,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Thank you for this course. The content is very throughout and yet explained simply. I had a hard time with understanding the attention model, the explanation in the course is not enough, but after all, it is a complicated architecture. The labs help. Thank you."
5900,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The grader  has some bug.Even with correct output and with no bug in the code, it gives incorrect grading. Firstly the criteria to pass is so stiff(80% means to pass for every function).Secondly the bug in grading function grades incorrect for correct codes."
5901,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Andrew Ng does a great job in introducing Sequence models in this course. However, I have the feeling the theory behind all the concepts falls short. There are just too many different subtopics being covered instead of focusing on the main concepts of RNNs."
5902,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Compared to the previous 4 courses in this specialization, I felt this course a bit less on details. It may be just me not having the required level of understanding. It just felt like I could've used a little more details. Andrew is awesome as always."
5903,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The programming assignments were pretty hard this time. I think, Andrew should spend more time to explain the concepts in the video lectures. Took me a while to get this stuff since it is a little bit more abstract than the previous specializations.."
5904,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This last course of the series while still being excellent, it had a few minor issues in the assignments and was quite hard compared to the previous four. Nevertheless, I still learned a lot from it and I am really grateful for it being available."
5905,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very interesting and well taught course. The only disappointment is that it focuses almost completely on NLP. I would have much preferred working on other topics too, like for example time series with LSTM, which instead didn't even get mentioned."
5906,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,You should try to leave access to the previous code I wrote in the previous weeks or help out a little in week2 exercise I really struggled to get some of the code done because I didn't have access to my previous notebooks because you locked them
5907,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course is very interesting and well organized. Certainly the content is appropriate for the cost of the course. The only flaw, for me, is the lack of mathematical demonstrations, but I know it is impossible to cover this in a single course"
5908,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This course helps you build the basics for natural language processing using deep learning methods.
5909,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good continuation of RNNs covering theory and Python exercises using a few algorithms and uses cases. I would love to see more content and more interesting examples to implement in Python. Still, this is a nice introduction to sequence models"
5910,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Amazing information. My one complaint is that the assignments don't help you understand how to work with TensorFlow. Most of the time I would read the documentation on the functions and follow the syntax. Maybe it simply comes with practice.
5911,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I really liked it, however I don't feel like it really went into some of the more practicle issues with sequence models. I was left feeling like I wouldn't really know what to do in a situation where I had highly variable sequence lengths."
5912,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I preferred the first specialization courses. The explanations are not so clear as the explanations in the first courses. I will make the NLP specialization to have a better understanding. Anyway, I recommend the specialization. Very good!"
5913,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It is a very good course. Andrew Ng explanations are very clear and easy to understand with a lot of good examples. On the other hand there are some confusions or errors in the backpropagation part of the programming assignment about LSTM.
5914,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I am rating this course 4 because It doesn't give any guidance about future career paths and next things to learn. The explanations are very good. I understood complex things like GRU, LSTM, Bidirectional RNN, attention model very well."
5915,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"While a great introduction on RNNs, I felt there could be another week of lectures given the complexity of the algorithms being explained. Likewise, the programming exercises felt unpolished in some parts, like in the expected outputs."
5916,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good. To make it perfect, would have liked it for the Assignments to have less bugs (cf. LSTM backprop), and a longer course with extra weeks to present LSTM in the context of prediction (finance, weather, pattern recognition,...)"
5917,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course! only negative is that problems would really hold your hand.  I don't think there is any way I would pass a whiteboard test on any of this (then again a course to get me to that level would have to be double this length).
5918,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very useful materials, but a little hard to digest. It will be more helpful if course lectures and slides can dive a little deeper into each model and provide more granular technical details."
5919,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Exercises are sometimes vague and can be done without full understanding of the material. No officially given notes. No reading material that explains the concepts more clearly and in detail.
5920,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,One of the best course i ever taken. glad to be part of such wonderful course teach by prof.andrew ng. learn a lot about sequence model and NLP. Highly Highly recommended for beginner in NLP 
5921,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great Course, very insightful excercises, really enjoyed it - unfortunately some issues with the programming excercises."
5922,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"the course content was really impressive, but some topics need to be explained in detail. Also working of LSTM should be further described in detail. Programming assignments are really fun."
5923,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"great course, lots of implementation details that are important were glossed over, while other areas had too much hw hand-holding + strict requirements on what the code needed to look like."
5924,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very glad I took this course!  A little rough around the edges as far as video / assignment quality, but seeing that this is the very first run of this course, I know it will only improve."
5925,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The material was great. Some of the programming assignments ramped up in difficulty or lack of perfect execution. However, I still gained extremely valuable information from this course. "
5926,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The lecture for Sequence model was good motivation to get interesting about text and audio processing. All of lectures were very fundamental and intuitive. Thank you very much. Prof. Ng.
5927,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good and fun course in the sequence. However, it would be very nice if there were some examples of using RNN for things such as self driving etc, outside the realm of speech and NLP"
5928,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course videos are very good. However the optional parts of assignments have lots of issues and errors. Please update the assignment to reduce the time wasted unnecessarily debugging.
5929,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very interesting exercice and assignments from which a lot is to learn. Content quite complicated which will require from me to come back for review and deepen some points. Thank you !
5930,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It was necessary to study extensively the Keras framework to fulfill the code tasks. I suggest an extra module with small simple RNN modeling exercises to better adapt the framework.
5931,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall, I really like this module. One possible improvement might be providing more information for backpropagation. Maybe as an optional video or just reading materials. Thank you."
5932,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,nice course even few chapters could be more detailled technically speaking. However the assignements are very nice and helps to complete the understanding. Many thanks for such work
5933,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Thank you Andrew Ng for making me comfortable with the deep learning topics on Sequential data...Assessments were interesting ..can be made to enable us better play with the models
5934,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Week 2 was wonderful to learn and understand. I wish to explore more on LSTM and Attention based models. Video lectures were not enough for me. Still I am happy for what I learnt.
5935,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Overall it is a good course. Much need to improve on the feedback of grading of which output is not really helping. Referring to global variables in assignments are really tricky.
5936,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall a very good course , i wish the model construction ( i.e. the rationale in stacking up the layers) is covered in bit more detail, otherwise an excellent course, no doubt."
5937,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The assignments can be made a little difficult. Can Include assignments of Image captioning, that would have been great. Overall a great course. Sir Andrew Ng, superb teaching!!"
5938,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,great course as always by andrew. would give it a 5/5 but had some sloppy mistakes regarding the formulas. overal impression : exceptional and highly recommended. thanks andrew!
5939,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Compared to the previous courses, this one was a little hard for me. Because Dr. Andrew tried to squeezed a bunch of information in this course. It's a wonderful course though."
5940,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some of the assignments are very difficult to pass. I think I understand the concepts but the instructions for the assignments could be a lot clearer and provide more guidance.
5941,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is great. The assignment sessions are a little confusing. It would be good to show the complete codes for the test cases so that test errors can be easier to debug. 
5942,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I did not feel like I got a super clear understanding on how to use various library functions in keras, I did gain a really good understanding of the underlying models though! "
5943,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This is amazing course with much more interesting labs and practical examples
5944,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is great but I was hoping to have a part about time series inside.
5945,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Few bugs with some jupyter notebook assignments, otherwise ... great course!"
5946,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It's pretty difficult for me, but I learn a lot of knowledge in this course."
5947,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great Course on giving an Introduction to RNN and basic NLP architectures !!
5948,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Please allow students to complete assignment from scratch. Without any help.
5949,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A lot of spoonfeeding. Stuck at optional exercises and a lot of wasted time.
5950,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,More exemple than Only NLP would have been nice ! But overall a great course
5951,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This is a good course. However, this topic deserves much more detailed work."
5952,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The week4  on transformer is rushed and rough. Overall ,it's a good course."
5953,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The most difficult of the series. Yet I enjoyed learning so many new things
5954,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great Content with real-time example looking forward to doing more courses
5955,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Please remove repetitions from videos, really annoying thing. Great job :)"
5956,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Awesome notebooks to gain practical experience with deep learning systems.
5957,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This course is very interesting! Again! It requires basic Keras knowlegde.
5958,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Course is excellent. Assignment, however, could use some more refinement. "
5959,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It was really good, but I think I still didn't understand transformers!"
5960,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It would be good to extend some more detailed explanation in this course
5961,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,need some reviewing in the optional parts of the programming assignments
5962,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent course content, but poor maintenance of programming assignment"
5963,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Provides good exposure to sequence models for NLP and speech processing.
5964,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Instructions for labs are not clear enough, especially the layers part."
5965,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great exercises but videos were slightly rushed. Overall a good course.
5966,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good course. Feel a little bit rushed. Difficult to retain the concepts
5967,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The content is great, but the programming exercises are full of errors."
5968,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It was great course, "
5969,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is the course 5 week 4 coding assignment. See my comments in response to post by @marcus-waldman for detail
5970,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,too much content and not much chance to exercise. I will suggest for more frequently and smaller programming assignments through out the course!
5971,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Outstanding course, but the end of it uses many architectures not fully explained (GRU and such). Incredible course and specialization, though!"
5972,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent course, but I would have liked to work on predictive maintenance examples leveraging RNN and LSTM networks. Big thanks to whole team."
5973,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is nicely designed and every topic is explained in a very lucid manner by Andrew Ng. Must be done as a beginner in sequence models.
5974,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Simplified content delivered in just the right way to give a perfect intuition of the complex concepts. Really enjoyed doing the whole course. 
5975,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great content, but Andrew often starts his phrases then restarts saying them. Audio could use some cleanup, then this course would be perfect!"
5976,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Most optional assignments contain bugs/errors. Other than that, this is a great course, just as the 4 other courses in this specialist series."
5977,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I give 4 star because some fomulas are not correct! Though this course is really great. I can not understand why you made mistakes on fomulas.
5978,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great materials and programming exercises. The programing exercise in week 4 could be improved for the more beginner-friendly style probably.
5979,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This one seemed to go through to quickly over the details especially with the word vectors and the LSTM, would have appreciated more examples"
5980,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good course, though the assignments towards the end were a little too centered around Keras, which I personally don't care for very much"
5981,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The instruction of using Keras in the programming assignment is unclear. There are many bugs as well, hence we have versions 1, 2 and 3 etc."
5982,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"No time series analysis, and some problems in the guidance of some programming tasks. Mainly de first week, the rest of it was pretty good."
5983,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good course. I would suggest to split the first week into 2 weeks, which makes easier to grasp all the concept with a deeper understanding."
5984,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some assignments don't have enough descriptions to help me deeply understand the core concept of the algorithms. Hope it can be improved.
5985,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The assignments of this course ""Sequence Models"" require sufficient knowledge of Keras and Tensorflow, which is not friendly to beginners. "
5986,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"There are some problems in the code of the assignments, as well as the expected outputs, which costs a lot of time for me to figure out. "
5987,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very Awesome Course i got knowledge about  Sequence to Sequence models and how they works in practical software . Thanks to Prof.Andrew.
5988,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Exercises' grader didn't accept all the functions correctly, lose much time searching in the discussion."
5989,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"First three chapters where just great, fourth was very good, but fifth was not very understable and assisgnments were quite annoying."
5990,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great instructor, good and challenging assignments. Thank you!"
5991,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Everything is great except the last assignment - trigger word detection is hard to save and submit, and i can't even open it sometime. "
5992,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course (except from the last assignment, that was extremely difficult in comparison to other assigments). Totally recomended!!!"
5993,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Muy difícil en comparación con los demás anteriores 
5994,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This is pretty involved - especially the last week
5995,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I would prefer to be the student of Sir Andrew Ng.
5996,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,这节课主要还是以入门为主，没有讲太多理论知识，序列模型部分讲解跳跃性较大，需要结合更多资料去仔细研究
5997,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Too much details! Too little time. More exercises! 
5998,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent content, the auto-grader not so awesome."
5999,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good course but can be too rushing sometimes.
6000,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course
6001,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A little too difficult to understand from scratch
6002,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A little bit less quality than the previous ones.
6003,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,More programming examples/exercises would be good
6004,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"useful to familiar with RNN, GRU, LSTM and so on."
6005,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Exercises are a bit tough and misunderstanding...
6006,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It will be nice if the videos are more detailed.
6007,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course was really interesting and well done
6008,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,One task has a bug and impossible to complete. 
6009,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,hope there are more projects about time series
6010,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The programming assingments have some errors.
6011,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Amazing Course with Awesome practice problems
6012,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,not as fun as CNN course but still so useful!
6013,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,a little bit too hard for the sequence model
6014,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I found this course bit difficult to grasp. 
6015,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,last lab with transformers had some errors
6016,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good but too long to follow with patience
6017,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good introduction to sequence models
6018,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, specially the programming assignments, they help much mor than the videos to undertand the core concepts."
6019,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Had some issues related with the jupyter notebook. Sometimes I had to restart the kernel to get the keras model working
6020,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I think a totally different course for NLP & CNN neeeds to be rolled out including their implementation in tensorflow.
6021,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Last notebook causing server problems. Large amount of material (theory) covered by compressed programming excercises.
6022,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course content and well explained by Andrew, looking forward to apply the learning to solve real world problems."
6023,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some items on the assignments were confusing or misleading. But the content of the course was rich and well explained.
6024,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent course. It would be better, however, if I could easily download the course slides and notes for quick recap."
6025,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really nice course but some programmation exercises isn't well built. (Compared to the other courses of this section)
6026,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Week 3 last assignment must be improved.I faced a lot of problems related to submission.All other aspects are amazing
6027,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent as usual, but not quite up to the usual standards, I felt some of the lectures and exercises were rushed..."
6028,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Cool exercises and good explanation, just too much focus on text mining and too little on actual RNN's if you ask me."
6029,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Nice intro in recurrent neural networks.
6030,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I would have liked to have had an assignment covering beam search but overall it was excellent introduction to RNNs.
6031,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"overall it's great, but I think this course is a little bit high level on RNNs, I expected more content on GRU/LSTM."
6032,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course but it took them forever to finally open it.
6033,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Text Processing exercises should be added. Most of the examples are from image and speech. Overall good experience.  
6034,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great Course. But could improve on explanation part. And could teach more about architectures such as LSTM and GRU.
6035,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course ! However, there are several errors in the project assignments and it has been delayed for two months. "
6036,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I felt like important concepts were glossed over far more in this course than previous courses in this curriculum.
6037,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The update and correction of error should be more effectively and actively managed. That's the only error so far.
6038,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Everything is good, except the last week's material needs more explanation to avoid confusion and frustration."
6039,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The assignments should be after each topic or lecture because in the end is difficult to enhance the knowledge. 
6040,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good course, but the errors in the last exercise was annoying and I missed a bit more about speech recognition.  "
6041,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Only complaint is that the exercises are too easy when all answers are practically given in the hints section.
6042,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Interesting topics but some fairly frustrating assignments. Happy to get a better understanding of NLP though! 
6043,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Fine training, had some tchnicalities with the pythonn notebook which cost me loads of time."
6044,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,very good course for beginner to study.  But not enough clear for some concepts and models.
6045,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The practice was more guided than other courses. Felt that the Coursera team did all for me
6046,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Perfect course except there are are some mistake/ambiguous instruction in course assignment
6047,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course. Would like it if he kept his notation consistent with what is in the papers. 
6048,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"a lot to learn, content is well presented as usual. one of the assignments requires rework"
6049,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Seem like not as good as before course,Wait so much time but is not clear as course before"
6050,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,good course. Especially good in explaining the reasons and thoughts behind the algorithms
6051,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Trigger word detection assignment notebook has some bugs. Had a hard time submitting it
6052,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"There are many bugs in the assignment. Else, the material content and videos are great!"
6053,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really good but I guess you should teach more about how to apply all these models more. 
6054,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course was really straightforward, but the assignment hits was not really helpful."
6055,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Decent introduction but the material presented needs more time and training to absorb.
6056,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Too many errors are in assignments. Also, Some APIs from Keras are not well explained."
6057,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The assignment code instructions (specifically the code comments were very confusing).
6058,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"it was hard to catch up to all the new stuff, but as a first step, it's not that bad."
6059,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I feel the programming assignments should be revised. I have encountered many errors.
6060,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,There were a couple of problems with the grader that made this course less enjoyable. 
6061,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Missing the notes in between the videos like in the Intro to Machine Learning course
6062,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"some of the auto graders were a bit buggy, but overall loved the course and material"
6063,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Nice content. Spend some time on homework since I'm not very familiar with keras.
6064,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,coding style is out-of-date. Could the TA update the coding homework regularly?
6065,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I wish there was a more thorough tutorial on the Keras programming environment. 
6066,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Another awesome course. But I feel Word Embeddings part could have been better.
6067,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"A very good course in terms of application , again Dr. Ng did an excellent job "
6068,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,There is some noise in the video which is greatly disturbing. 
6069,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Maybe should give some advice about the future learning path.
6070,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course focus on natural processing and music examples. 
6071,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Much harder than previous ones, but also really interesting."
6072,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Would have liked an example outside of nlp, otherwise awsome"
6073,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,very important course concerning sequence in Deep learning.
6074,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Content is little less intuitive compared to other courses.
6075,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,codes are too long and it is taking time for codes to run 
6076,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeat but less than the first four courses.
6077,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The program in the exercise is a bit hard to understand.
6078,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good when it came. Annoying for the 2 month launch delay
6079,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,  i'd like to have applications more suited to real world  
6080,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,it would have been better if he used more visualization 
6081,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,There were a lot of problems with notebook task grader.
6082,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, but too many mistakes in the assignments."
6083,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,thank you for this. this give good knowaledge for  me
6084,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good content, it would have been good to do more keras"
6085,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really Nice course to get basic understanding of NLP. 
6086,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Trigger word detection: submit homework is so hard...
6087,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great insights, helpful notebooks, good explanations."
6088,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Again, programming assignment should work flawlessly! "
6089,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course to understand sequence models and NLP.
6090,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,un poco lentos los ejercicios y repetitivos comandos
6091,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good introduction to RNNs and their variations.
6092,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great professional-level instruction and exercises. 
6093,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Super excited to finish this course. I've tone of questions not answered in forums I'm still waiting answers.
6094,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This was the toughest one of the 5. Great learning, but may be it could've been made a tad bit more intuitive"
6095,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,the course is very comprehensive however more details about how backpropagation is done would be great !!!
6096,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The quiz section needs to improve. It would be helpful that notes be also given as an outline of the ppts.
6097,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"A bit too much material without going in depth anywhere. Also, code-grader sometimes behaves very strange"
6098,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some inconsistencies with the HW level (week 2 basically told you what to write) but very good lectures.
6099,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Keras exercises tough to get through based on provided information, but the content was superb as always"
6100,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really good course. Exercises are not always connected to the core of the deep learning problem though..
6101,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course is great , in the assignments it is  better to stick to single package and TF is preferable. "
6102,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Highly recommended course to understand the concept of speech recognition models, very real use cases."
6103,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great lectures, but ""fill-in-blanks-and-rewrite-math-formula-using-python"" assignments were annoying"
6104,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good course. Only, sometimes a bit more cryptic respect to the other ones in the specialization"
6105,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great lectures. The quality of exercises are also amazing, although some typos should be fixed asap. "
6106,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Some concepts need to be explained more detailed, otherwise I feel hard to keep up with the lecture"
6107,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great class. However, they are some typos/mistakes in the explanations of programming assignments."
6108,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,learned a lot but I wish their should be some sort of referencing material for further exploration 
6109,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Lecture content is pretty good. Exercises are much more finicky (less robust) than prior courses.
6110,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"more excercise should be there in last course, but overall content was very good"
6111,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The Attention model still needs more explanation. I haven't completely grasped attention models
6112,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,More errors than most in the projects. Likely due to the rush of getting this final course out
6113,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good course, informative and easy to follow. Only problem I had is with its auto grader."
6114,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really good course but compared to others optional assigments lack instructions in this one.
6115,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,My only  complain is Keras. A crash course/lecture on Keras would benefit this course a lot!
6116,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course is of high quality. However, it is not as good and clear as the previous courses."
6117,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Content needs a few improvements in quality but otherwise a valuable and instructive course.
6118,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some techniques for keras need to be clarified. Generally a good course
6119,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I liked this particular set of lectures, too, now on to something new."
6120,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It required coding on keras and tensorflow not appropriate introduced.
6121,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The Course is great! But the programming assignments has too many bugs
6122,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"it's very difficult to submit last programming exercise ""trigger word"""
6123,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,More clarification on what we are doing in the programming exercises
6124,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great introduction to LSTMs, RNNs, GRUs, NLP and speech recognition."
6125,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great content but I felt it was bit rushed and squeezed in 3 weeks .
6126,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The quality was a bit down but still very worthwhile and interesting
6127,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great practical experience. Would have preferred a bit more theory.
6128,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,it covered a lot of interesting topics but it was a bit high level.
6129,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,great course to understand intuition of sequence modeling for NLP.
6130,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,课程虽然很短，只有三周的课程，但难度明显比之前四门课程要大，编程练习一共有7个，第一周的三个是最难的。但仍然是最优秀的深度学习课程。
6131,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Well explained, I feel like it could go a bit more in depth though"
6132,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Muy buen curso, resulta sumamente estimulante el ejemplo de woebot"
6133,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The good course as the theoretical basis for RNN and other models
6134,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Attention Models is not that clear. Everything else is excellent.
6135,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Excellent lectures. Some programming exercises need more clarity.
6136,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very hard, but not your fault, very good course ! Thank you !!!!"
6137,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Exercises have less quality than the ones in previous courses.
6138,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,El curso esta muy bien peor deben añadir subtitulos en español
6139,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I think this course needs to have a continuation to go deeper.   
6140,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Grader was wrong sometimes. Typos everywhere in the notebooks.
6141,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"awesome, but need more animation for understand general works"
6142,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good course but can add more models to get a deep dive in NLP
6143,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Really helpful and intersting
6144,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Quite a good course overall.
6145,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,difficult to understand well
6146,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As always, amazing content !"
6147,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Cool course, learned LSTMs."
6148,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,amazing introduction to RNN
6149,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,more exercise would be nice
6150,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,希望讲得更细一些，多给一写intution帮助理解
6151,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Assignments are awesome!
6152,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It's really interesting!
6153,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Andrew Ng. is too good.
6154,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,it is really not easy..
6155,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,more material is needed
6156,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good work by Andrew NG.
6157,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It was a great lecture
6158,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"希望编程部分可以更加自由, 做填空题没意思"
6159,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It is fine but long 
6160,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very informative!!!
6161,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It was Amazing !!!!
6162,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good course overall
6163,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Concise and helpful
6164,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,理解有点困难，没有前几个系列通俗易懂
6165,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,really good course
6166,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I liked the course
6167,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good demonstration
6168,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I gave 5 stars to other courses in this series but this one doesn't deserve 5 stars. There were many typos and bugs in the assignments compared to the other courses of the specialization.
6169,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Video Lectures were excellent.
6170,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The lectures are wonderful as usual but the practical assignments are so extraordinarily perplexing that it does not seem to improve the learner's comprehension by a significant extent.
6171,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Boring course:
6172,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The lectures were not as good as the previous andrew ng. courses, and the exercises were quite bad in all honesty."
6173,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Just one observation, the general view I have from this course is very positive but compared to the other courses the program exercises in this course are more difficult to understand. "
6174,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,A good introduction in Sequence models. Unluckily the programming assignments are more of a guess work then real knowledge as there are too few possibilities to check the own code. 
6175,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Despite being a great introduction to many NLP concepts, the programming exercises are a bit too much ""fill-in-the-blanks"" and not challenging enough. It is still a great course !"
6176,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Course contents were very good, but the assignments could have been improved a lot. Couldn't get much value out of the assignments rather than blindly following the instructions."
6177,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The class covered too less on the Sequence models such as LSTM and GRU. It has too much domain knowledge related videos.  Also, it does not have any video related to Time Series. "
6178,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The videos are good, however the assignments are too long with sooooo many text inside. You have to make it more efficient somehow."
6179,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Assignments in this course are relatively  less organized. You have to read a lot of description first and then code and have to go back/forth between code and description. 
6180,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I believe that the course needs more time allocated to the incremental teaching of this rather large subject area with varied applications. Just needs to be a better way.
6181,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course was especially interesting in week 2 and 3, but the assignments for week 1 were confusing and sometimes it was hard to follow where the logic was coming from."
6182,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,This was the most difficult to understand course in the whole specialization. Would have enjoyed more if the course material was a little more spaced and elaborated on.
6183,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Practical Assignments with Keras wasn't motivating. I spend more time to deep into the Keras rather than into the course topic. I prefer them to be using TF or Python.
6184,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The supports in keras programming was so poor, that I could not quite understand each step. And the server was horrible, always got 405 response when saving my codes."
6185,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,This course should be broken into 4 weeks and spend more time building skills with Keras.  The number of hours listed next to each assignment is unrealistically low.  
6186,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The lecture was great but the errors in the programming assignment (especially in formal-typed formulas) really wasted a lot of time and make me confusing at first.
6187,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The ideas presented here were clear, however I found the programming assignments non-intuitive and not practical. I spent on them way more time than I wish i had."
6188,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"I enjoyed all the courses, from my personal point of view this course was not that fun as the other courses. Except for the trigger assignment it was awesome!"
6189,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Too much was given in external python code for the first week's assignment (that should be learnt by us): not a good thing for us to gain a good understanding
6190,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Worst course of the specialization, content is interesting and Andrew keeps explaining really well but programming assignments are clearly of a lower quality"
6191,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course is great but the tasks in Keras are too complex without background knowledge. Therefore, a reasonable introduction in Keras would be desirable."
6192,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Far less detailed than the other ones. The programming assignements are less interesting too, as a great part of the work consist of reading documentation"
6193,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,g
6194,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,..
6195,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"in comparison to the previous courses from this sequence, this one is even less structured - ptobably this is because even broader knowledge is tried to be shown in only 3 weeks, but i feel like a lot is skipped between videos (which are ok) and the tasks - in many assignment tasks in this course it is not very well explained what is meant to be done - i mean this especially in case of Keras objects. In many cases it is quite unclear how those classes are supposed to be handled in the context of our task. There are some hints but those are mostly links to documentation (btw, some of the links are no longer up to date), but it is often not too well explained which properties those objects have, what one can do etc. so one ends up with trying using those objects in different configuarations, then googling around, looking on the course forum for the right answer but it is very difficult to derive it. There should be more precise instructions regarding handling Keras objects - the examples in the documentation and in blogs are often much simpler than those from assignments so one ends up not knowing what is going on. In summary - there is a big jump and a big gap between the intuitions in videos (which btw are much more fuzzy than those in first cources in the specialization, the intuitions get more and more superfluous as one doesnt go into detail) and what is being done in the assignments. One thing i really liked about hte previous assignments was that when writing the code one could really know very well what is going on. And this is no longer the case in this course..."
6196,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"As we head to the last course in the specialization (and the last two courses are the ones that interested me), we have error after error in the assignments, including problems with the kernel that are not obvious until you've struggled with incoherent stack trace output for a while."
6197,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"It's helpful to have this course since there aren't enough beginner-oriented courses on these topics, especially ones that also get into actual equations like he does. However I think he doesn't provide enough explanations of complicated topics like GRU's and LSTM's. There are lots of confusing aspects of both such technologies, and he could afford to spend even more time in explanation than he does."
6198,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Unlike the other courses which Andrew Ng provides, this one contains many spelling mistakes in the programming assignment, the programming assignments are less structured and understandable (missing or wrong information in nearly every assignment) and an introduction to keras is missing. I found it great that the keras framework is an important component of this course, but unlike the tensorflow introduction it is missing here. It is frustrating, when you might have the right functions but no information how to input and determine the correct variables for the functions. Anyway I found the outline of the course very good as it gives a good overview of many methods and how they work. To my mind the consistency of the assignments and also the story telling needs to be improved to reach the level of other courses where Andrew is involved. It appeared more chaotic and the complexity of the algorithms is overwhelming, so a better introduction to how they work, might be appealing. In the end, I worked through it and I gained a basic understanding of keras and RNN algorithms. So it was definitely worth it."
6199,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"A nice course after all, but I expected something more. It is valuable if you know nothing about RNN and NLP, or if you know something and want to go a little deeper and work on some guided keras examples."
6200,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The subject matter was a good introduction to various RNN model types and concepts.  I have to dock a couple stars, however, as the course leans so heavily on Keras implementations during the assignments that it really should be listed as a firm requirement.  While I feel that I'm more experienced with both RNN models and the use of Keras now, it was a struggle with what felt like a lot of cargo culting for me to get through most of the assignments.  I don't consider the brief lesson on Keras at the end of the second course to be sufficient training, particularly if much time has passed between taking that course and this one.  A brief ""Lesson 0"" on Keras is sorely needed at the beginning of this course.  Otherwise, it should be explicitly and firmly communicated at the start that the programming assignments require a certain familiarity with the Keras framework.  Overall, I do highly recommend this course, but be forewarned about the need to be familiar with Keras before starting."
6201,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The material provides a strong overview of sample problems for which sequence models work well. However, the class doesn't give users the conceptual mastery needed to apply sequence models to new or related problems. The issue is that the motivation and concepts underlying new architectures aren't well-explained (they're often an afterthought at the end of a lecture). This approach to teaching feels backwards.
"
6202,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Toward the end of the specialization, there seemed to be a noticeable drop in both the quality of instruction and the programming assignments.  Course 5 on sequence models was much more ""hand wavy"" than Course 4 on convolution models.  At the end of Course 5, I'm still not sure if I learned anything meaningful other than filling in a few blank lines of code to complete the assignment.  There was much less intuition provided about the nature of recurrent nets, and then translating that to code was foggy.  More attention needs to be paid to how and what the framework is actually doing, not just giving hints at filling the blanks."
6203,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The best part of the course are ""intuitions"" presented by Prof. Ng. The worst parts are technical problems with Coursera infrastructure, and insufficient number of mentors available to offer suggestions. For example, in forums there are some doubts about the optional parts of assignments (bad formulas etc.), but these quite valid questions are just not addressed by anybody. I would also suggest adding a separate course on Keras as a part of the specialization, because the Keras introduction offered in a specialization is way too basic. This makes it quite difficult to go through the assignments for the sequential models. It would also be helpful to extend the last two courses to five weeks or so, to cover course material in more details."
6204,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The lectures are great, but the assignments are not: apart from the hours wasted restarting notebooks (!), I've found very frustrating to have to go between ""write `j = 0` on the next line"" to ""figure out Keras documentation by yourself, the grader will only tell you `it's wrong`"" (Keras having such a horrendous API, with many functions having 20+ arguments, and sometimes the course tells you to specify an argument that's not even in the documentation!).There is no balance between the two (you're mostly told ""write this, write that"", with no space for thinking as in the first course of the specialisation) and the assignments are primarily a chore you have to go through, even though you won't learn much, if anything, from them."
6205,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Really big struggle with dinos, versions of workbooks, and sometimes no logical way to explain why grader does not validate a working notebook. Pain, frustration, taking away time from proper learning."
6206,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This course provides great introduction to RNN and other sequence models and their application to popular fields such as NLP and audio processing. It does great job in providing the motivation and intuition behind the creation of such sequence models (e.g. LSTM, GRU, Word2vec, GloVe), however I feel that the theoretical explanations need to have more depth. During this course I had to refer to other websites to gain more technical understanding about LSTM and GRU. The programming exercises are nice, they cover many popular topics such as NLP, speech, and music processing, but I struggled when doing it in Keras. I wish some pointers were provided on where to learn it before doing the assignments."
6207,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Too many stability issues on the platform to get the notebook up and running.
6208,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The content is didatic, as well as the explanations, a reasonable course for a real beginner. However, the material is one of the worst I have seen: a lot of errors that are indicated with notes between the classes and MANY annotations and sketches from Andrew in the slides. It mixes up handwritten annotations with digital text, a complete mess. I had to edit the PDF in order to make something useful, even though a lot of information is either missing or floating somethere in the slide. Besides that, some videos are not edited properly: it is possible to experience many repetitions of the same phrase."
6209,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Although the course content is very useful, the hurry in which the course was put together does show. Video was clearly under-edited (as is apparent by Andrew repeating some statements in the expectation that the previous one would be edited out), and the auto graders caused me to waste many more hours than truly needed to get my assignments in a format that would be accepted. Finally, I was very disappointed at the fact that the specialization was launched and then the last course pulled out, so I had to pay two months even though I had budgeted my own time to finish it in one. "
6210,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Nice to learn how RNN's work. But too rough around the edges for a 5-star score. 
6211,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"To be completely honest, I loved Dr. Andrew's method of teaching. But the assignments just flew over my head because I didn't have enough hours of practice of Keras under my belt. I know Keras is there to make things easy but it's very difficult to just trying to pass the grader. To goal of assignments was fantastic, I mean, generating music, etc. sounds really amazing but I feel that if there was some more time given to make us better in Keras and other technicalities then I would've loved this course much more! "
6212,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Good but i expected more. The main thing i like about first 3 courses, they were really deep. In the last two courses we have skipped the backpropogation. Now this is something which you can keep optional. I like the way Andrew Ng teaches, going to the basics, and that is why I came here and paid 40 euros per month. Also, there are few stuff missing like Generative models, Adversarial networks, GAN and etc. It would be good if Andrew can have more courses related to this and deep (as it is deep learning :))"
6213,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"By far the most difficult of the 5 courses but giving it a lower review since the programming assignments are rushed through to finish 2-3 in 1 week which gets hectic & understanding of key concepts is lost. Also, it would help if more time is spent in the videos to explain the concept/model/algorithm used in the assignments since I close to understood nothing from the assignments in spite of completing them. Finally, the instructions too were not clear in the assignments."
6214,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Interesting and full of excellent lectures as always for Andrew Ng. The programming assignments quality was not as good as the other courses in the Deep Learning specialisation though. They drop straight into Keras with no information/introduction, use several complex model architectures without explanation,  in week 3 4 out of the 5 'your code' exercises were about audio sampling, not very relevant.  Again, excellent lectures, just not great programming examples."
6215,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Sorry to say they dropped the ball on this one. The last course of this specialisation has the most advanced topics thrown at you in just three weeks, and it's even more cookbook-like than in the previous courses. The material of this part of the specialisation would require a whole course in itself, perhaps for +10 weeks. Here, I found it is at best a guide for self-study, _if_ you have the time for that. Also, support in the forums was very minimal."
6216,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"There are some challenges with the videos eg. repetition, blank audio, variability in speaker's volume (difficult to hear).  In particular perhaps 'Bleu score' needs to be redone.  I did not enjoy the labs mostly because I don't have much interest in NLP BUT the 'emoji' and 'trigger word' labs were excellent!  Especially the 'trigger word' lab should be the standard for all labs, it was very well written: clear, good flow, no mistakes."
6217,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The scope of this course was highly relevant to me, but unfortunately many of the class materials were broken or otherwise incorrect, making some ungraded portions of the assignments difficult or impossible to achieve.  Activity on the discussion boards indicates many people have tripped over this for at least the better part of a year, but no corrections have been made.  This was quite frustrating and wasted a good amount of my time."
6218,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,soooo difficult...
6219,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,感觉没有前几次课程详细了，视频部分
6220,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good course
6221,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It was tough :)
6222,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very usefull!!!
6223,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,too long- good
6223,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"There were lot of bugs in the assignments taking up lot of time to fix.  The course was okay, I liked the other courses in the specialization more."
6224,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,easy to learn
6225,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A bit cryptic
6226,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good material
6227,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The Keras programming exercises are quite weak. Please re-think how to teach them more systematically. Currently it is quite a lot of hit and miss.
6228,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The lectures were great, but the programming assignments could have been structured better, especially the final assignment which drove me nuts."
6229,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,That was much harder than the previous courses of the specialization. However it felt like the videos are more hasty and less understoodable 
6230,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,There was a bug in a programming assignment notebook that took too much time to notice that i was doing ok but the expected ouptut was wrong
6231,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The programming  assignments required some extra effort to understand Keras which I thought may need an introduction video like tensorflow.
6232,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,very useful
6233,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,a bit hard!
6233,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The assignments were not good i think. Because they explained the consepts too long and complicated as like we've never seen these on lectures. I was waiting assignment  to require more insight about architecture and less python programming knowledge. This comment is for week1 assignments in special.
6234,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Several grader issues, only 3 weeks of work, and a lot of errors in the solutions... In addition, less content than in the other courses..."
6235,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The earlier courses were easy to understand, however, this was way too difficult. Andrew Ng did not make this easy like the other courses."
6236,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Compared with previous courses, this one seems to be rushed. The focus on applications seems to be much higher than the theoretic side."
6237,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very Useful
6238,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,productive
6239,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Thank you.
6240,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Excellent
6241,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Average
6242,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great
6243,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:, Programming assignments were not to the level of the prior courses in the series. Should have more illustration of using Keras/Tensorflow. Assignments either were too spoon fed or there was too little reference information whereas prior courses had a good balance. Many of the keras links are dead.   
6244,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"For me, there was a large gap on time between when course 4 and 5 were offered (months).  This unfortunately was enough for me to forget everything I learned about Keras.  "
6245,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Of the courses in the specialization, this one seemed the least organized and rushed. Some of the assignments had some annoying auto-grader quirks that made troubleshooting a pain. Overall it is still worthwhile, just be ready to search forums for help during the assignments."
6246,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Too many thing introduced in programming assignments without explanation. Why the high dropout values? Why sometimes one dropout layer, sometimes two? Many things are just given as a formula, and not explained in a way that would let me make my own network for my own problem."
6247,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Not as great as the other courses in the specialisation. The assignments can be a little off putting, but lectures are top class again."
6248,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Week 1 took double time to be completed. Times proposed for the assingnement are underestimated.
6249,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Assignments are not up t the mark.. Expected to have high vocabulary size word embedding assignment, Machine Translation assignments"
6250,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great
6251,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,good
6252,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,nice
6253,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,good
6254,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good
6254,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"I took this course after a long pause after I finished the first 3 courses. I would NOT recommend doing it that way. As a result, I felt rusty on some of the coding practices. "
6255,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The lessons are very good as always, but I'd like to be tested more in the programming exercises rather than literally being told what to do and then fill in missing parts of already completed code. Still super glad I took the specialisation, it has been extremely helpful. "
6256,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This course was good but in comparison to the other courses in the deeplearning course series, this course lacked adequate depth. "
6257,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course is a good course because the lecture Ng.W ,but the exercises is not easy for our beginers for such tools like kears."
6258,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The programming assignments in this course are difficult to implement. The detail descriptions are needed inside the notebooks. 
6259,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good
6260,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good
6261,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,good
6263,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This course was at a really high-level and barely scratches the surface of Sequence Models. Didn't really go into much detail behind any of the theory, and the programming assignments were mostly done for us, so you don't really end up learning much. You certainly won't be ready to have a job solving NLP problems after taking this course. If you want that, you're better off going through actual college courses online."
6264,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"First of all, the programming assignments are really copy-pastes. There is nothing really to storm your brain for. Second, many of the ideas presented in the video lectures are very brief and short, skipping the explanation parts. After taking this course, I now know the names of lots of algorithms and models, but that's all I know, only the names. To get broader knowledge on them, I have to look somewhere else now."
6265,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Had to rate this lower due to problem with the final assignment. Submission and saving situation was a nightmare, I had to redo my work several times. Please fix this, it's a real downer at the end of the course. Otherwise, content stellar as always."
6266,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course content is pretty good for breadth. However, it falls short in going into depth. Assignments need to be more open-ended and probably a bit more involved. It appears that we are cutting and pasting code that is already written in comments. "
6267,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Good subject, but a lot of the course material (like lecture slides and problem sets) was either unavailable or out of date. "
6268,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The videos  are great - however it would be useful to provide some help on how to implement the concepts programatically.
6269,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The assignments need better instructions and there is a huge jump in complexity when going from lectures to assignments.
6270,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course content and Andrew Ng are great. The submission process of the assignments is absolutely dreadful. You might get 0 points for correct answers or not, depeding on...well, I have no idea on what. Maybe it's Jupyter Notebook, maybe it's Keras or maybe it's something else. But you must have good search engine skills, since you will most likely spend a lot of time in searching the discussion forum for answers."
6270,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,very basic ..would have wanted much advance level . 
6271,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This course presents an interesting review of several strategies that are part of the state of the art. However, it is impossible to assimilate how they work in the time devoted to each one. The ""fill in the blanks"" exercises do not help much."
6272,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This course gives a nice overview of sequence models. If it is true that I do not have an engineering background, I felt it got sometimes a little bit too abstract as compared to other courses of the specialisation. However, I recommend it."
6273,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"I would advise giving more tutorials about TensorFlow and Keras. Those are your main tools and eventually, in many cases we were only required to complete the gaps which don't give you a true understanding of how to use those frameworks."
6274,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Not as good as the previous courses in the series, and some of the assignments where broken, and super hard to debug."
6275,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Only on NLP applications, it would have been great to apply GRU or LSTM on numerical data like finance for example."
6276,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"May be this is my observation but this is the 1st course where I am unable to understand most of the explanation by Andew Ng, and the course exercises are more like the python coding like slicing, dicing, filtering, and how come this course is same for last 3-4 years, not even objective questions, There has been a tremendous breakthrough in the field in last 3 years and the course content is still the same. "
6277,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,too much information for such a short course. We only get a very superficial understanding of concepts with very little practice to solidify our understanding. The assignments involve implementing very small parts of much bigger systems. I guess the course is ok to get a general idea of the concepts but for deeper understanding of the topics a longer course or multiple courses would be needed. 
6278,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This is a very interesting topic. However, I believe the course itself can be improved. I believe there can be more information about NLP and sequence models in lectures. It would be nice to add lectures with practical suggestions about training and tuning sequence models. There were lots of typos and mistakes in notebooks that were found by other fellow students and not addressed by mentors. "
6279,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course overall isn't as good as the previous 4 ones especially for the PA part, I can pass the grader even with wrong output. The PA improvement sometimes just create more discrepancy. The PA is just a walk through of how to building those basis models, but those little bugs will drain extra hours to figure out. I think this course is kind of a prototype one especially on PA part. "
6280,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Compared to the previous courses, this was a disappointment. There is not as much content as I expected and the homework exercises are not well prepared. If one spends more time with debugging than with ""learning concepts"" in a basic course like this, then something seems wrong. "
6281,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"That was tough, how the weights are stored and their dimensions inside the 'time steps' can be explained by adding one more video, btw the course is awesome if you want to learn the basics of sequence models, you should have completed the previous 4 courses before diving into this. I will always remain thankful to Andrew Ng for providing this type of platform."
6282,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Codes are not explained. Some codes files are given 
6283,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Works as a primer. Assignments aren't that great.
6284,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The assignments are more like quests - most of the time is spent guessing what is required. The changes made require more programming skills rather than the understanding of ML principles.
6285,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The programming exercises can be better polished, there was quite a few errors that caused unnecessary confusion to the students. Many times, I felt like I was fighting with the Keras/Tensorflow API rather than solving a ML problem."
6286,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Courses had some issues with the grader, and there were some instances where the expected output in the assignment didn't match the actual output, despite it being correct."
6287,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Need more detailed explanation and programming assignments are way too easy.I would suggest to make advanced courses for people to improve their knowledge keeping all this courses also considering not all feel it very easy.
6288,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"this one was quite fast, should cover transformer in details and also other NLP models like BERT, GPT, MORE QUIZES should to be added based on tranformer acrchitechture, GRU and LSTM should me made short as LSTM is dead "
6289,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Every notebook was super well explained and made except the last one, which was very confusing, unfortunately. I did not enjoy doing that one :( Also, I think the transformers network were not deep explained as hoped. "
6290,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The content covered is interesting, but I feel like the explanations are not as intuitive as the previous 4 courses"
6291,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Nice but little stressful. After completing 5 courses in a row, really feeling exhausted. Thanks for the good work. "
6292,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Quite a lot of bugs in the first week examples. It took me too much time until I browsed the discussion forums.
6293,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"the videos are programming assignments need some serious updates, too many typos and wrong information present"
6294,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I think you have to know more keras than is explained in the course. The keras documentation it is not enough.
6296,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Positives : Excellent lecture material. Assignments broadly are well structured. HIgh bar set by Andrew Ng.   Negatives: Assignments have too many errors and mistakes as of Jan 2019 (especially but not only in the optional / ungraded sections) for me to be confortable 100% recommending the course. Instructions for assignments are also not fully fleshed out. 
6297,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This course is good for introduction to sequence networks, but I felt this is not at par with the previous course 4 (CNN). This feels a bit hurriedly done, with many important things only just touched upon. This should have been a 4 week course like the previous module. Then due attention could have been given to the field of speech, audio, sequence domain."
6298,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course is generally good. However there are some issues with lecture videos editing (some sentences are said multiple times), and with activities (e.g. default settings hardcoded in one of notebooks, didn't let have output shown as reference, also in some cases automated grader has some assumptions, which need to be found using trial and error method)."
6299,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Great course, great activities and really good programming excercises. "
6300,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"I've got mixed feelings about the whole Specialization. Many very interesting topics, but on the other hands I don't feel like there's any takeaway knowledge for me. Until the very end I've been feeling completely lost in the exercices. I'm proud to have been able to hold on until the end but I'm not sure it's been an useful use of my time. "
6300,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"The material really is great, but work needs to be done to improve the assignments, specifically submission and grading. On the last assignment I spent way more time troubleshooting the grader than the content of the assignment. It can be very frustrating to have to do this on a MOOC where no human support is available. It appears, specifically for this assignment based on discussion that this has been a problem for a very long time. "
6301,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The learning embedding part is kindof confusing
6302,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Excellent content
6303,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Great course but has been dumbed down too much
6304,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Video content is excellent but I am not very much happy with the assignment task. There should must also be some video content based on the assignment because the some codes some libraries are not taught.
6305,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"In comparison with other courses in this specialisation a lot of assignments were poor quality - vague descriptions and code logic (especially week1, asign 2 & 3)  or  just broken (last week3 assignment)"
6306,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"With respect to the others, this one seems to be prepared almost in a hurry and the learning curve is very steep and sometimes the programming assignment don't have a nice progression as the others. "
6307,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Videos were really informative and were equally interesting, but I believe that the programming assignments lacked a bit in clarity. The instructions were really unclear, it could have been better"
6308,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Quite a few bugs or abstractions in this course, in comparison to the others the projects feel a bit rushed and pushed together. Andrews's explanations and video lectures were still great though.  "
6309,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"this course is the most difficult in deep learning specification, but i think Andrew NG should design more homework for word embeddings and bidirectional rnn, i do not understand how it works yet"
6310,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course was great. However, coming from finance I was also hoping to see some examples which use time series so I can get a picture of how I can extend this knowledge to my specific domain. "
6311,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The module was really good in explaining the concepts, but there wasn't any deep dive on the equations and mathematics behind with the results of making the code assignment harder to achieve."
6313,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Really interesting course with fascinating applications. However, in terms of difficulty, it is a significant step up from all the previous courses. A lot of time is spent figuring out the syntax even though the concepts are crystal clear. ( Probably as it is a collaboration with NVIDIA). The programming assignments could be improved. "
6314,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"It´s a fairly good course, with lots of cool topics covered on it.  My main complain would be that the subjects covered are dense enough to be arranged on a four or even five week course. Instead, for some reason, all the stuff has been squeezed within three weeks, which makes the lectures shallow and rather cryptic most of the time."
6315,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The course was great, as ever. But some of the programming exercises were very frustrating. Oscillating from very easy to very difficult, with some unclear (and sometimes erroneous) instructions. I felt this was in sharp contrast with the previous 4 courses of this specialisation, for which the course and exercises were perfect."
6316,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,the course covered a lot of essentials and gave me a rough idea of how stuff NLP and sequence models work. Though at the same time the content often left me confused and overwhelmed. the Convolutional Networks course was far better. 
6317,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Great lectures, great teacher!"
6318,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"The subject is fascinating, the instructor is undoubtly competent, but there is a strong feeling of lower quality with respect to the other 4 courses in the Spec (in particular the first 3). Many things in this course are only hinted to, without many details. Man things are just said but not really explained. Many recording errors as well. Maybe another week could have helped in having a little more depth in the subject"
6319,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Although the course lectures are great, as are all the lectures in this specialization, some of the assignments have rough edges that need to be smoothed out. It is particularly frustrating for those trying to work on the optional/ungraded programming assignment sections that have some incorrect comparison values, as much time will be wasted trying to figure out the source of the error."
6320,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Excellent lectures, terrible exercise material. E.g. ""You're implementing how to train a model! But we've done the actual training for you already! Your exercise is to add numbers A and B! Number A is 4. Number B is 11! Enter A + B in the box below!"" Also, someone did a search-and-replace and converted every sentence into an individual bullet point to reduce readability."
6321,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Unfortunately, this course is the less valuable in the specialization. Programming assignment very interesting but no introduction to Keras. To pass the assignments, forum support has been vital.  I also found lectures not clear even to the point that to catch some concepts you have to google around for more resources. Unfortunately, I could not suggest this course."
6322,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Compared to the other courses in the specialization, this appears to lack depth and clarity one could expect. LSTMs and GRUs are somewhat out-dated now, given the speed of innovation in the field, and Transformers are here to stay (for now). Unfortunately, Transformers are very poorly covered.  "
6323,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Getting the input parameters correct for the Keras assignments is on par with the satisfaction of dropping a ring, contact lens, or an expensive object into the sink, and spending an hour looking for it inside the disassembled pipes, through built up hair debris and molded dirt."
6324,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Overall a great course, thanks to Andrew NG for his great explanations. But a very bad support, I faced many issues in submitting the assignment due to technical issues (notebook not saving) but no dedicated resource to help me. I spend lot of time in resolving my self."
6325,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Feels again like authors tried to put everything into just a couple of weeks, thus the course turned out to be messy with lots of details hidden. Even though there was a lot to learn, I am still not sure if I understand correctly how to build a simple sequence model."
6326,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Really good to understand the basics, however, it doesn't use the latest TF2 and the exercises are either trivial because too much pre-worked, or too hard because it doesn't give the information required to succeed."
6327,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Programming assignment instructions are not well written (clear), and as a result it is easy to get stuck on something of little relevance to deep learning. Also, I would suggest that you make the lecture notes in written format available."
6328,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Esperaba que los ejemplos fueran de otra forma
6329,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Should add some instruction videos of Keras
6330,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,does HW created/reviewed by different ones?
6331,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The assignments are not very satisfactory.. 
6332,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The programming tasks were very simple. I doubt that you can really learn anything when you just need to copy the text from the task description and paste it. The content of the tasks was excellent, but the level of personal involvement was minimal."
6333,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The lectures were OK ... better LSTM tutorial by Chris
Olah"
6334,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"In my oppinion this course was too hard. I mean I could solve the assignments, but there was too much ""magic"" in those assignments. At least for me it was hard to develop enough intuition. But maybe its also due to the fact that I am more interessted in image based convnets where I have more background."
6335,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The course does not explain how to use Keras (it's assumed you've finished the previous course). What's more a lot of code parts is implemented in some difficult way (for loops instead of Python's builtins and idioms like any or list comprehensions). I'd love to see more materials on speech recognition.
6336,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"I guess as the subject matter becomes more complex, more training is required on the underlying frameworks being used- Keras, TensorFlow etc. Did not feel that sufficient time was spent on understanding the underlying frameworks. Also the TA work is of spotty quality. But I love the way Andrew teaches."
6336,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Week 4 labs need to be better, the layers under the classes were confusing"
6337,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Assigments are pretty bad. I think in CNN and in RNN we should focus more on fundementals and build everything in numpy.  RNN course isnt for building intuintion(deep knowledge) you just scratch surface.
6338,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,The lectures cover the basic design of the models but don't help teaching you how to actually use them.  I learned more by reading blogs to get the programming assignments to work then this course.
6339,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Lectures/Videos were excellent, the assignments were very poor (loads of errors in the code not corrected over 7 months since the course went live)"
6340,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,The course videos were very lengthy and difficult to follow. Many topics discussed in course video were not part of programming assignment
6341,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Good introduction to the concepts. Really poor quality videos and exercises. Very frustrating when working on the assignments. 
6342,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,The videos were very helpful but the programming assignments were way too easy for this certificate to be worth much. 
6343,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Good lectures. Programming assignments are useless fill-in-the-blank exercises, you don't really learn much from them."
6344,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,5 stars for lecture videos. -1 star for the terrible transformer programming assignment which is simply frustrating.
6345,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,The programming assignments really are like pulling teeth.  There's not really enough guidance leading up to them.
6346,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,The course videos and the programming assignments were lacking.  And there was no support in the forums.
6347,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Spent more time trying to work around a buggy grader than learning the underlying concepts.
6348,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Not so well explained as the other courses
6349,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Too narrow focusing on applications in NLP
6350,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Programming exercises was very confusing.
6351,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Course should have have more descriptive
6353,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I found this course boring and also too many assignments in a single week.
6354,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Issues with assignments. Took more than 4 hours to figure out the problem.
6355,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,This was the least clear course among the others. The others were great!
6356,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Would like to learn a bit on how back-prop works when using attention. 
6357,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,fairly more complex and deeper as previous courses. Nice ex. however.
6358,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I feel this course is not as carefully designed as previous courses
6359,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,  Trigger word detection - v1.ipynb bug is annoying. Course is good.   
6360,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,ほぼ英語、プログラムの課題の問題を解決するのが非常に大変だった。bugも多いのでこなすのは苦労した。ビデオは相変わらず素晴らしい
6360,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Little unsatisfied with the final part of the specialization.
6361,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Too hard to understand compared to the previous coursed in this specification.
6362,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Tough to comprehend. A little bit of written explanation might have helped.
6363,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Was very difficult. please add more expiation of mathematical equations.
6365,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,it's not bad but it's also not perfect
6366,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Too many errors in the assignments
6367,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The mathematical part is little. 
6368,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,second week was hard to follow 
6369,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,So many errors need to fix.
6370,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,very tough for beginners
6371,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Keras is a ball-ache.
6372,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,too hard  
6373,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Good Course but lectures and assignments could have been better. 
6374,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Should be five weeks instead of three. Dive deeper into Details
6375,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,lecture videos were good but in assignments let us code more.
6376,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,assignments are very hard and needs lots and lots of search 
6377,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Lack of Keras training made it often hard to do layer code. 
6378,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,This course needs more instruction on Keras.
6379,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Poor explanation for alot of things 
6380,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,good
6381,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,As a course i think this was way too fast and also way too assumptive. I wish the instructions were a bit slow and we broke down more into designing bilstms and how they work and more simple programming excercises. As a whole i think 1 full week of material is missing from this course which would concentrate on the basic RNN building for GRUs and LSTMs and then move on to applications. I usually do not review these courses and they are pretty standard but this course left me wanting and i will consult youtube and free repos to learn about it better. I did not gain confidence on my understanding.  Barely scraped through the assignments after group study and consulting people who know this stuff  (which defeats the purpose of this course i believe. It is to enable me with concrete understanding and ability to build these models . It shouldn't lead me to consult others and clear out doubts .)
6382,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"i really learned from this course some ideas on recurrent neural net, but the assignments of this course are not completely ready for learners and are full of mistakes which have existed for more than a year. those mistakes in the assignments mislead learners pretty much if they do not study some discussion threads of the forum. this course has the lowest quality among all of Dr. Andrew Ng's. before the updated versions, a learner had better have a look at the assignments discussion forum before starting the assignments."
6384,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,One of the weaker courses in the specialization. Felt rushed.
6385,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Assigments too complicate without a necessary guide and help.
6386,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Less clear instruction than other courses in specialization
6387,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Bugs in the programming assignments grading kills the flow
6388,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,This course is not satisfactory than the previous courses
6389,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,boring and uninformative
6390,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Too difficult.
6391,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Needs work.  
6392,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,This course was comparatively boring than previous 4 ones
6393,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,I feel sad.
6394,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,sucks
6395,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"The good: Videos with a great overview of the theory, and some of the applications."
6396,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Grader is the worst and no help even in the forums inspite of getting the same output the grader is still failing and no one is telling why. Forced to drop out of this course now
6397,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,I would like to abandon this course and stop paying for a course I want to prepare better before maybe launching a new attempt..
6398,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Very bad experiance in the programming exercises. you will not able to run exercises and finish this course. A waste of money!!
6399,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,It's unreasonably a bad course!
6400,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,many ideas where not clear and more application use cases needed.
6401,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Can't even see the programming assignments without paying money. 
6402,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I felt the last week had too many things packed together
6403,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Was little hard to understand at times. But it was good.
6404,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Not as well done as before. But, still very informative."
6405,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Doesn't teach much about keras which is sorely needed
6406,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,GRUs are poorly explained. Unable to get past Week 1.
6407,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Not practical, Assignments can drain your energy."
6408,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,The explanation is not quite clear in this course
6409,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Glitchy Notebook, Minimal assistance at forums."
6410,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,This one is way more difficult than the rest:(
6411,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Poor and unclear explaination, waste of time"
6412,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,very long with many unnecessary videos
6413,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Not practical and just complicated!
6414,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Se deben mejorar las presenaciones y los subtítulos
6415,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,a bit outdated due to lstm being not that s-o-a now
6416,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,can't submit the last assignment.
6418,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great courses. Only 4 because too short !
6419,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,More In depth optional videos are needed.
6420,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I found it not that easy to comprehend.
6421,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The assignments were mostly copy paste. 
6422,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Not that interesting for me personally. 
6423,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,jupyter notebooks with a bunch of error
6424,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Fantastic lectures and helpful quizzes
6425,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Notebooks seemed to be made in a hurry
6426,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,good insights for RNN and time series
6427,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some of the tests were a bit too easy
6428,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,With effort easy to digest content
6429,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Need more inputs for keras library.
6430,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This sections was very interesting.
6431,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,an easy way to learn the conception
6432,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,my knowledge about DL is upgrading
6433,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Wish there was a tutorial on Keras
6434,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Not good as the previous courses.
6435,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It seemed a bit rushed in the end
6436,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good place to get back to basics
6437,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,not as good as the rest of the 5
6438,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Good course to introduce to NLP
6439,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This was really a great course.
6440,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excelente curso, aprendí mucho."
6441,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,课程很棒，内容很多，但是作业编程的提示有些少，耽误了不少时间
6442,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I finally have a superpower!!
6443,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"An average course, it is detailed though some of the ending materials get too difficult for me to comprehend."
6444,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Assignments are very buggy and instructions misleading or incomplete. However the core material is excellent
6445,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Require a little depth, considering the complexibility. At least 4 Week course should be their instead of 3"
6446,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"There were a lot of issues with the notebook especially, for the week 3. The concepts were well explained. "
6447,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Would have required more of the ""intuition"" building material. Worst of the 5 course series, but still ok!"
6448,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Contents are way too easy and the video recordings are often a bit broken (repetition, blank audio, etc.)"
6449,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"incredibly boring. I mean at some task you literally asked to type in ""= False"" instead ""= None"". Really?"
6450,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,There are some mistakes need to be correct in the assignments. Still a lot of improvements can be made.
6451,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The assignments should be improved. More prep on Keras will help improve the efficiency of learning.
6452,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,The practical tasks is bad. You are simply needed to rewrite formulas to python most of the time.
6453,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Very interesting topic but coding exercices and quizzes were a bit clunky and in need for ironing
6454,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The content is super interesting, but the assignments are more of the same 'fill in the blank'."
6455,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Put to much focus into getting the Keras code to work instead of truly learning the algorithms.
6456,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,I found this very hard to follow along.  The concepts were too heavy and needs a slower pace.
6457,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Theory explained in a better way, but practicals could have been more involved and better."
6458,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Really Nice course. Could have been more fun if Keras and it's functioning had more focus.
6459,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Course is got but grader compilations are horrible spent more time on them than the course
6460,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Not as good as structured in explanation nor in programming assigments as the last ones.
6461,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This is only good enough, not good course. All previous ones were 5 stars, definitely!"
6462,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,the lab and programming is not as intuitive as the first two course in the specilism.
6463,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Overall a great class. I had some trouble understanding the programming assignments.
6464,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"This felt the the least prepared and organized course of the series, unfortunately. "
6465,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,give projects that we can build from ground up without your inbuilt function.
6466,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Good theoretical overview - project just require you to fill in lines of code
6467,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,Lectures on week4 are not complete as confirmed by mentor in the community
