1,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Tons of editing errors in lectures, and the programming problems rely more on knowledge of Keras (essentially untaught throughout the course) than they do on understanding of lecture material. A disgraceful end to an otherwise solid course sequence.",1,0,249
2,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"This course is by far the weakest out of the 5 course sequence. I did well in it (96.8%) but I think the programming exercises did not help build understanding of sequence models. Often I found myself just trying to get through the programming because I felt it was more an exercise in reading Keras documentation. I think you can pass this course without a solid understanding of what is going on in the sequence models. The programming exercises should be revamped to focus more on understanding what is happening in the program rather than trying to figure out Keras syntax (which is also useful, but perhaps better suited for a prep course).",2,0,645
3,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Full of appalling errors that have been present for over 1 year.  No one fixes it.  It is clear that since Ng was let go by Stanford and Baidu, he is trying to earn a living with deep learning_ai.  This apparently is not working as the small income from Coursera is not sufficient. As a result the prerecorded classes remain on Coursera to accrue some residual income.  But, Andrew Ng and the staff are apparently gone.",1,0,419
4,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"I really like the deeplearning.ai specialization. And also I like the Sequence Models course. However, I feel that I have learned less during this course comparing to the other ones in the specialization. First, I believe it was an extensive use of Keras. Whereas the framework is great, it would be much better for understanding if all the exercises were in numpy, whereas Keras tween-projects be optional.  Doing both numpy and Keras versions would allow to better understand the material and learn through repetition. Second, even though the course is great, I perceived the number of errors/typos was much higher than in other courses. Is that true? For example, the Jazz Improvisation exercise was a nightmare. Overall, thank you for the course. Despite those problems, I would still recommend it.",3,0,802
5,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"The lectures were great. Andrew is a wonderful teacher, but the assignments were beyond miserable. Jupyter notebook is probably the least stable, most infuriating piece of software that I've been forced to interact with. I spent countless hours trapped, not able to perform the most basic of operations, such as saving my work or submitting. I lost work innumerable times. I, like others, eventually resorted to ""saving"" my work by copying it into a text editor on my system for fear of Jupyter sabotaging me. Even if the system was stable, most of the assignments were worthless as learning experiences. The majority of ""programming"" boiled down to playing a cryptic game of fill in the blank. Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone in its current state. Especially as a paid service. I really expected better quality.",2,0,835
6,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Keras is required to pass the assignments but no training provided for it. I can learn it myself of course but then the question is this - what am I paying for?,1,0,160

I am a working professional (13+ years), but just getting into the field of ML and AI. Apologies for flashing this preamble for every course that I review on coursera.",5,1,264

10,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,"I went through all course of DeepLearning.ai Specialization. While I was more, or less happy with first 4 courses in this specialization, I have a very bad impression regarding ""Sequence Models"" course. Actually, quality of the courses is gradually declining, starting from 5 stars for very first course in specialization, ending with 2 stars for ""Sequence Models"".",2,0,365

13,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The course is very good and has taught me the all the important concepts required to build a sequence model. The assignments are also very neatly and precisely designed for the real world application.,5,1,200
14,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Learnt a lot about new concepts in RNN and LSTM. Really wanted to learn about these models. This course helped a lot. Everything was new and so fascinating. Loved this course and our teach Andrew NG.,5,1,199
15,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Loved the course - it was very interesting. It is also pretty complex, so will probably go through it again to review the concepts and how the models work. Thank you for this wonderful course series!",5,1,199
16,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,Professor Ng seems a little bit confused about the subject and is making unnecessary analogies rather than going deep into the algorithm and explaining the context as he did in Convolution Neural Networks course. I hope that the videos are revised and professor explains the topic more clearly rather than depicting himself to be confused as well on the topic.,1,0,360
17,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great hands on instruction on how RNNs work and how they are used to solve real problems. It was particularly useful to use Conv1D, Bidirectional and Attention layers into RNNs and see how they work.",5,1,199
18,Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:,Many topics are only quickly skimmed over. Serves as an overly brief introduction to RNN.,2,0,89
19,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The lectures covers lots of SOTA deep learning algorithms and the lectures are well-designed and easy to understand. The programming assignment is really good to enhance the understanding of lectures.,5,1,200

21,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I'm blown away by how quickly this series of courses brought me from thinking a neural network was a magic box full of fairy dust, to being able to understand even the (al)most complex of network architectures and what makes them tick at every level at a glance. A lot of time has obviously gone into structuring this course; not an ounce of fat present and the format of developing intuition before diving into the nitty gritty and optional further learning resonates with me on so many levels. Thank you Andrew Ng and the team at deepmind.ai and coursera!",5,1,557
22,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very good. I have no complaints. I though instruction was very  clear. Assignments were very helpful and challenging enough that I learned something, but not so challenging that I got stuck too often. ",5,1,201
23,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Hope can elaborate the backpropagation of RNN much more. BP through time is a bit tricky though we do not need to think about it during implementation using most of existing deep learning frameworks.,5,1,199
24,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I was really happy because I could learn deep learning from Andrew Ng.,5,1,70
25,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"If not Internet, I would not have been able to study a world-class Deep Learning course at an affordable price. Thanks Andrew and team.",5,1,135
26,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The only trouble with this course is that we're talking about seriously deep networks. That means it's difficult to present working, practical cases (jupyter notebooks) to work all the steps.",5,1,191
27,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This series of course provides a comprehensive overview of NLP algorithm and different applications. I really enjoy the projects the deal with audio files. The course skip the linear algebra and differentiation part that not everyone wants to look into. But I hope it will be better if we could also implement the data processing functions of different types of sequential inputs, since data preprocessing is also significant",5,1,425
28,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"My knowledge has been upgraded to the next level through Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization. Through systematic and easy-to-understand explanations, quizzes, and program exercises, I was able to increase my interest and understanding of Deep Learning. Based on this, I really want to change my field of work and work related to Deep Learning. My goal is to make myself a person who uses AI without being replaced by AI.",5,1,424
29,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This was a great intro to RNNs and Sequence Models. ,5,1,52
30,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I had struggled with the complexity of Sequence Models ever since I started learning about Machine Learning models. This course gave me an easier intuition to the sequence models without dwelling too deep into the mathematical complexities. As a person who has very little experience with Linear Algebra this helped me a lot to understand and apply such architectures to solve problem. Thanks Prof Andrew and the team! :),5,1,421
31,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I think it is a great course.  There are some issues here and there with notebooks and related materials.  However, considering the large and detailed amount of content in this course and it being a new course, things not being 100% perfect is OK by me.  I would rather have the thoughtful content and exercises, versus something much lighter that would be easier to produce.  Thank you to all who prepare these courses.",5,1,420
32,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Absolutely fantastic. I am Deep Learning professional focusing on Computer Vision and had worked in Vision all my life. I started learning multi-modal AI, and found that my foundations on Sequence Models was shaky. So I came here and learned much about them. Now I can continue my journey towards muti-modal AI such as CNN-RNN hybrid models for image captioning. Such lucid explanations! Andrew Ng is a great teacher.",5,1,417
33,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Superb course structure, the assignments beautifully complement the lectures and the amount of guidance makes it easy even for someone not too acquainted with programming. As a suggestion would have liked slightly organized detailed presentations which would help in reviewing the course material later by glancing through rather than going through the lectures. Over all an awesome course with great learning. Thanks   ",5,1,420
34,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I enjoyed learning all the five courses of this deep learning specialization. Special thanks should go to Dr. Andrew and the instructors for delivering the course material in an interesting manner. Quite frankly I'm a little bit disappointed with this specialization being too short. Expect more courses in this specialization in the future. (Maybe reinforced learning).Again thank you all for this great experience.,5,1,416
35,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I'm grateful for the chance to take the 5 courses in this program for a very affordable price.  It is the best educational deal I've ever come across.  The courses are well taught, I will continue on to take other courses offered online on the same subject.  Thanks to  everyone who made this possible, and I will definitely try to make a contribution to humanity as Prof. Ng has challenged us to do.  ",5,1,402
36,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Pretty interesting course, learned a lot about natural language processing using differen approaches for different input types. There were some challenges with completing the assignments, but they're managable by checking out the forums for help. Although I might not fully grasp the content material or algorithms, I still learned a lot or at least gain some familiarity through the lectures and assignments. ",5,1,410
37,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thank you Prof. Andrew Ng and team for these series of courses. The entire specialization was brilliant and the way the programming exercises were structured, using real-life examples was the best part of all. Prof. Andrew Ng always has a smile on his face when he explains the concepts and he is so humble that he thanks us for spending time doing the specialization, whereas it should be the other way round.",5,1,410
38,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I highly recommend this course to all audience. Professor Ng is an outstanding researcher with tremendous amount of experience. Moreover, he is a well-known lecturer in terms of his clear explanation and interesting examples provided in class. I have gained a lot of experience as well as knowledge in the field of deep learning. I am very grateful for his time and effort for providing all the resources here. ",5,1,411
39,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The best online course I've seen anywhere about recurrent neural networks! Prof. Andrew Ng explains everything in such a simple manner. For example, understanding the structure of LSTMs is quite challenging, but Prof. Andrew Ng explains it in a very easy to understand fashion. Likewise with GRUs, Seq2Seq models, bidirectional RNNs, etc. And the code exercises have very beautiful and detailed explanations. 

",5,1,411
40,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thanks Professor Andrew Ng and team for the deep learning specialization. The course material was well designed for online learning. The assignments were perfectly manageable with a few hours of investment every week and the learning was very effective. Last but not least, I found Professor Ng's wisdom, insights, tips to be invaluable to anyone regardless of their level of expertise in machine learning.",5,1,406
41,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was the best course among 5 course specialization. It was well designed, structured and application oriented. Assignments were pretty fun to solve as they involved solving real world problems. This course gave me direct exposure to industry level problems and helped me gain more insights towards the future of deep learning. Because of this I am really excited to continue working in deep learning.",5,1,404
42,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Hello Andrew, I am a big fan of you. Learning from your every course. Very unfortunate that I can do that remotely only. ",5,1,121
43,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The Sequence Models course covers state-of-the-art deep learning methodology as of 2018. The instructor is awesome. The assignments help solidify concepts presented in lecture videos. One nitpicking comment. This course, being relatively new, was less polished compared to the other courses in Deep Learning Specialization. I'm sure future updates will eliminate glitches and errors in the near future.",5,1,402
44,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Good course to help you understand how sequence models work and how to apply them for various problems. Majority of topics are explained quite well. Practical problems sometimes could be a challenge, but every problem has hints and a bit of theory provided. Overall this course was  a very positive experience and I do recommend it. Special thanks for the people who made this course possible.",5,1,393
45,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I liked that this course was a bit harder than others in the specialization (well partly because It felt like notebooks were made in a bit of hurry here) but it was a good thing for me, since I had to think more on the programming excercises, read Keras documentation, derive backprop equations - and I believe such engagement with the topic really allows to understand and remember it better.",5,1,393
46,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It's been so rewarding to apply what I've learned in the previous courses of the Deep Learning specialization to time-based problems. I feel I have a better understanding of how some of the ""magic"" technology like virtual assistants and speech recognition work. While the material in the first four parts was also very useful, the specialization would have felt incomplete without this course.",5,1,393
47,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Where shall I start...? This module was by far the hardest I made, but I'm really glad I was able to finish it somehow (Searching of my own typos was quite challenging task and I thought my head explodes). Anyway this set of courses is great and I will continue further in my path exploring the world of AI. Thank you guys for the effort you spent to share your knowledge with us. Great job!",5,1,391
48,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Another outstanding course about Deep Learning.,5,1,47
49,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course assignments were very interesing and engaging - clearly a lot of time has been invested in them.  The quizzes were not easy but also not too difficult.  The combined quizzes/assignnments helped reinforce the lectures.     As always, the lectures were great.  Perhaps one improvement would be to allocate another week for the transformers as this material was not as well explored.",5,1,391
50,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It's a great class, and Andrew Ng is a great instructor. I wish the exercises were a bit harder. Since the course is aimed at all and I am coming from a graduate degree in the sciences, I realize it's hard to cater to all educational backgrounds. I would have liked to see optional/honors exercises to get us more involved. Other than that, I loved the class. Thanks so much for teaching it.",5,1,391
51,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very effective mix of theory and practical examples, cemented by practice exercises in form of the programming assignments.  The guided instructions of the programming assignments are as valuable as the lectures.  I would recommend putting the ""errata"" readings *before* the videos containing the errors (as was done in an earlier course).  I also notice that some quiz questions pick up on nuances that were quite underplayed in the lectures, but going back over my notes, did find them.",5,1,488
52,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Smooth and hands-on walkthrough of basics of NLP and speech recognition. The flow of the course is very well-designed.,5,1,118
53,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Amazing course overall. Prof Ng's diagrams are the clearest explanations of DL models I have found anywhere and it's that clear a ton of thought went into planning the notations. The assignments are exciting and surprisingly fun. One could say that there is a little too much handholding throughout the assignments, but I understand that this course is more about the heuristics. Again, it's fantastic course overall and the resources provided throughout are truly unique to Coursera! ",5,1,485
54,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was my first AI course and I really made significant progress in my understanding of foundations of deep learning with this. Thanks to Professor Andrew's very informative course videos, grasping the complex concepts became possible. The quizzes and the assignments were challenging, made possible for me to use logic and develop new coding skills to go at it. I would recommend this course to everyone interested in AI/ML. Thanks to Professor Andrew for making this course.",5,1,478
55,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is an amazing course, it Provides a great Help...i have learned lots n lots of stuff  about NLP, Learn about recurrent neural networks that work extremely well on temporal data, word vector representations and embedding layers --that are explained in a concise manner, and more importantly I love the Attention mechanism, the  model that understand where it should focus...... its attention given a sequence of inputs.... amazing amazing ..highly Recommended.... Thankyou  ",5,1,478
56,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course was a great introduction to the world of RNNs. Starting from basic sequence models all the way through RNNs constructed with Convolutional layers, LTSM layers, GRU layers and wrapping up with the Attention Algorithm. It is great base work to start a Deep Learning career.  The course is very well structured and the resources in the forums were always life-saving. Very grateful for this course and I am waiting for the Advanced Specialization from Deeplearning.ai ",5,1,477
57,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Really good course for RNNs with NLP. Recommended to anyone who has completed the first four courses of the specialization. A thing to notice is that the last programming assignment is really hard to save and submit to your servers though it was pretty well organized.,5,1,268
58,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I really liked the whole Specialization, it is great: clear and interesting!",5,1,76
59,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Another Excellent Course from Professor Andrew Ng. The detail in the explanations are excellent, and the provided exercises using Jupyter are super fun to complete and put to the test your knowledge offering you at the same time a library of ideas and models to use in your future projects. I enjoyed this last course in the specialization quite a lot, thanks very much to Andrew Ng and the Staff from Coursera. I hope to see more courses like this in the future.
",5,1,464
60,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I love this course. Maybe about 1 and half year I was trying to learn DL. I thought about giving up because I wasn't able to learn, so, in May of this year 2020, Coursera opened its courses to undergraduates. I do not thought twice, at the same hour that I knew that news about free courses, I began this. Then, after that time I want to thank to Professor Ng and all colaborators on that site. One day I will be one of student of Professor Andrew Ng in Stanford. ",5,1,464
61,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A greatly knowledgeable course! I learned a lot about Natural Language Processing and explored RNNs, LSTMs, Word Embeddings, Seq2Seq Models, Attention Mechanism, etc. The course focuses more on the concepts along with providing the essential math. It was fun to implement Language Models, Neural Machine Translation & Speech Recognition. I would surely recommend this course to the ones who are diving into the world of NLP, and need a perfect introduction to it.",5,1,463
62,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A very systematic and well structured specialization course on deep learning by Andrew and team. The concepts are explained with a focus on intutiveness. The assignments and quizes help in understaind the concepts better and realising them with programming. Coming from zero backgrond of Deep learning to now being confident of using the concepts in my fututure research work, i would like to thank coursera and team Andrew for such a wonderful specialization.",5,1,460
63,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Another very good course, though not without its failings. Mainly, the Transformers' lectures and programming assignment were confusing and didn't go into enough depth to deliver the intuition.",5,1,193
64,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This end course is a little more  complicated than the previous ones, especially in programming homework. However,  it also inherits the merits of the special, gives learners the basic framework of sequence models. What impresses me most is the lesson of ""Debiasing word embeddings"", it shows that AI could be designed to do more against human stale thoughts, which sets up a  good principle for designing AI. Yes, it should be taught to new learners of AI.",5,1,457
65,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I d recommend this course to those who want to find their your paths as they are searching for what it is that makes their life fullfilling.

After so many hours, now I understand how proud we can fell of completing these amazing courses!

69,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Will give this course also 5 stars. The assignments were easy but required some knowledge of Keras.  So you have to invest some time on their site.Otherwise it's like fitting  pieces in a bigger puzzle. Most pieces are already layed out for you .. you need to just fit your small ones. ,5,1,286
70,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Course contents and coverage was best. Duration of 3 weeks is little too short to really understand all the details of programming exercises.  May be extend this to 4 to 5 weeks and spend little more time on speech recognition, music generation and other audio data processing would have helped.",5,1,295

I suppose these aren't coding classes, but I also feel some of the concepts aren't cemented as well as if the students were led through a more challenging, trial-and-error experience. That's hard to do, though.",5,1,338

83,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"I love Dr. Andrew, I seriously do. He has inspired me in the field of Deep Learning like no one else did. But I detest how this course is made so expensive and in a wrong direction. I subscribed and paid $225 and I still was not given a decent amount of time to finish the course, even when I asked for extension. If this is the way these courses are, its better of learning from youtube. It is not worth the money",1,0,414
84,Filled Star:Star:Star:Star:Star:,"Dry and uninformative. Immense space for improvement. Corrections should be made to videos instead of having numerous revisions comments after lecture.

I did already the NLP Specialization of DeepLearning.AI and wanted to learn more about the inner workings of neural nets and I was not a single minute disappointed by my decision! Extremely well done overall! In particular the course on Sequence models is very enjoyable and will give you all the tools and intuition necessary to understand the background and the basis of such models and how they work! You even have a last week on Attention-based models, which is a little bit introductory, given that Attention as a concept exploded after this course was developed. Nevertheless, it is very well executed! My only critique is that, the whole specialization was developed before TensorFlow 2.0, and later on it the assignments were ported and Keras is used. But during the lectures on will not find any introduction to Keras and all this content is left for the assignments. This requires from the student more effort to understand and use Keras. What can be a bit frustrating, because Keras API also evolved during this time. I would suggest adding a couple of videos or ungraded labs in order to teach the student a bit better how to use the framework. But well, this is a minor issue. 5 Stars are for the overall amazing presentation of what is indeed important, the Deep Learning fundamentals. Moreover, Andrews last video is just very much aspiring and a powerful message that everyone in the field should come in contact with! Congrats! I hope the team plan to execute soon an updated version of the specialization in order to incorporate the new advances and to adapt it to the newest DL Framework. Apart from that the theory videos are 5 out of 5. Clear recommendation!",5,1,1904

92,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is again a fantastic course and what a nice way to finish the Deep Learning Specialization. It is certainly the most difficult one from the whole specialization and has taken me a lot longer than I planned. This is partially due to the fact that focus is shifted a bit more towards the programming assignments and concepts that are only briefly mentioned in the lectures turn out to be crucial for the assignments. The forum helps a lot, without it I would not have  been able to crack the first week, especially the optional parts of the assignments. There were also a few errors in derivation formulas, that had set me back, but in the end I understood the concepts a lot better and found some nice complementary resources online. And the RNNs are more complex and seem more variable than other network architectures, so that is ok that this course is more difficult. Now I feel that I finally have a good grasp of Deep Learning concepts and have a nice set of skills. And the assignments are super fun and very useful. Thank you Andrew Ng and your team for making such a wonderful content. I teach at the university-level and I can only imagine how much effort goes into preparing such a course and at such a high level of expertise. I encourage everyone to take this specialization, this specialization is the main gem in Coursera, in my opinion.  ",5,1,1357
93,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It is apparent how much thought and effort has been put into creating these courses.  Dr. Ng introduces you to state-of-the-art CNN and Sequence models which are quite complex.  But he expertly presents it to you so that you can focus on the essential aspects and not the details.  In courses 1-3, you might feel like you're being spoon-fed in the assignments but it is really a great approach to ease you into the deep learning field.  In courses 4 and 5, there is less guidance so that you can become more independent and be able to figure things out on your own.  After all, this is how it will be in our future jobs - no more TA's then.  ",5,1,642

95,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I really enjoyed the course. As usually Andrew and his team of dedicated professionals did a wonderful job of explaining an otherwise very hard material in an accessible way. The distinction of Andrew's classes is that they really give the *intuition* about why a particular approach works. Sure I may forget which particular regularization methods exist, but I will remember *why* and *when* to use regularization. The details can be always looked up elsewhere.",5,1,462

100,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"     In the beginning, I found the instructor a little difficult to understand, even though he is very good at explaining complicated concepts simply.  I am sure part of the reason is that I was unfamiliar with the technical terms.  Once I switched on the captioning option, my comprehension improved however I noticed an average of at least one translation error per video and these seemed to be caused by the instructor's accent and were sometimes very interesting errors.  So, I guess the system could use a little more training with the specific AI vocabulary and/or adjusting the context error settings for the subject matter.",5,1,631
101,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great finish to the specialisation. I have learned a lot of the core details of how to proceed with my own Deep Learning projects. My one piece of feedback would be for an intermediary step, that requires more of the programming myself, as a lot of the intricate coding has already been done.",5,1,292
102,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great selection of topics, clear explanations from Dr. Ng, and coding exercises to allow the understanding of the topics. Perhaps I would have liked to see some Time series analysis in the Sequential Networks parts, but even though, it was a great course.
Thank you Dr. Ng and all your team!",5,1,291
103,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The course content is very good but the mistakes in the videos are being mentioned after the video. This is making us get confused a bit. It would be good if those errors are mentioned before the video itself so that we can look into that before watching the video and get prepared for that. ,5,1,292
104,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Excellent teaching, materials, and organization! It's great to include state-of-the-art technologies like Transformer and LSTM. I would recommend also teaching some practical skills (like TensorFlow) that students can apply directly in practical programming (beyond the course assignments).",5,1,290
105,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great appreciation to Dr. Andrew Ng. The course has been incredibly well taught. Thank you so much for your enlightening lectures.

112,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Fantastic course! Presents both the theory and practical uses in a straightforward manner that is easy to grasp. Programming assignments are a mix of NumPy and Keras API, with the former being more illustrative of the inner workings of RNNs and the latter being more practically useful.",5,1,286
113,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Excellent! Amazing! Such good quality of lecture and assignments. Thank you Andrew and team for giving me such a good overview of what i can use this for.

Thank you very much, Dr. Andrew Ng and deeplearningai!!!!",5,1,283
118,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course with interesting exercises.

123,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I can't thank Andrew Sir and Coursera enough for enabling me with this wealth of knowledge in NLP. With this I can dive deeper into NLP and look at a career change as well into this area. The course has immensly boosted not only my knowledge but also my confidence. Much obliged.,5,1,279
124,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"At the beginning this is very counter-intuitive. But later on when I am on the final assignment, I finally realized that we are not focusing on gradient descent, but architecture building and training set assembling!  When everything start to make sense, it is really intriguing.",5,1,279

I can really see how I can build upon this course to help me in what I am doing at work. I think there is definitely some room to go deeper on some of the topics e.g. don't just teach sequence to sequence but also broader uses of recurrent networks. Maybe a follow-up course? ... please???",5,1,389
129,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,First of all I would like to thank all of the people given me opportunity to follow this course.

Over the past few months I gained a lot of knowledge and experience from all of the courses and I hope now I can apply the knowledge of deep learning specialization for my future projects.,5,1,386
130,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This module of the specialization is a bit more complicated than the others; at least to me, I found the concepts more difficult to grab.",5,1,137
131,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I was about to give this course a 3-star rating unlike the other courses in the specialization, which I have rated 5 stars. The reason for that was the programming exercises in week 1. They are not interesting and do not impart a lot of learning. Please consider improving those. The reason I still gave 5 stars is because of the amazing programming exercises in weeks 2 & 3. Thank you.",5,1,386

135,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is the last course of the Deep Learning journey, and I felt like a learned a lot in it. Sequence Modelling is a different beast compared to non-time series models, but I've mastered it thanks to this course nevertheless. I would recommend this particular course to anyone who has a moderate understanding of deep learning and wants to get into time series analysis and nlp.",5,1,378
136,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A succinct overview of a number of ideas in sequence models. Some of these were covered in an NYU course I took 4 years ago (embeddings, LSTM), others I had heard about but hadn't had a chance to look into (attention). The assignments were set up to be pretty easy, but I think trying to do them from scratch rather than by filling in code would make for a pretty good project.",5,1,377
137,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It is a well designed course (especially for week 1 - week 2) which gave a comprehensive view of the sequence model. However, week 5 material can be better and clearer. To be specific, additional hints can be given in the coding exercise. Video can be better aligned with the material in the coding exercise.  Thank you Andrew and all the contributors for this amazing course!",5,1,376
138,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great introduction to sequence models/RNNs. The real-world examples were very illuminating. Again, as with the previous course in the specialization, I felt some details of how to run/predict NNs using keras were lacking, which could leave a student floundering if they've never used keras before. This is in contrast to some other, much easier, tasks where hints were given.",5,1,375
139,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Out of 5 courses offered I think this was the most exciting one as it combines everything learnt so far and teaches how to combine different NN modeling techniques to achieve desired classification/prediction features . For example, it is pretty much clear how one would  go about building an app that would describe a picture to blind people and do that in many languages. ",5,1,374
140,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This short 3 weeks courses will make you work a little, exercice take at least twice the time write. You will learn about the famous LSTM, and how to use it on various tasks.",5,1,174

The professor explains the concepts across very well, not only in this course but in all courses of the specialization. My only gripe is with the notebook/hub/grading system which especially in this course has acted strange and cost a lot of time. That said I've learnt a lot, and am quite happy with the course content. ",5,1,373
142,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Great course overall to learn the basics of sequence models and also get a brief understanding of the state of the art architectures used currently.

147,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The whole specialization is excellent. I highly recommend doing it. The only minor comment that I add is that Andrew should include some links for further reading (along the courses for each topic or theme). I know that anyone can quickly look up for them in the Internet (and they can be outdated) but that would make the specialization even better in my opinion.,5,1,364
148,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is Course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization, and the last one. We learn Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) /Sequence Model, which allow translation or trigger word (like ""Hey Siri!""). It's a completely different beast than CNN seen in Course 4. Again, nice videos and explanations, and well-designed useful programming assignment (TensorFlow/Keras and numpy)",5,1,363
149,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:," I Highly recommended this course on Sequence Models. The course is easy to follow as it gradually moves from the basics to more advanced topics, building gradually.

It  really give me a very good sense about what's going on with the Deep Learning in several areas. The course material is prepared in a way that it's very easy to catch up. Just one suggestion, this sequence model session is too short, lots of topics haven't got well deployed. ",5,1,352
160,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very very interesting but it's a lot more difficult than the other courses.  I did it out of sequence (no pun intended) (i.e. I skipped Convolutional networks to go straight to RNN, because they interest me more).",5,1,213

Very happy with the course, it provided everything I needed to know to understand it in detail and implement it. Thanks Andrew for making this course. ",5,1,335
175,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very useful course for me, since I am doing research in Natural Language Processing. As NLP require RNN  and its variants as its implementation, this course helped in implementing my task using the Seq2Seq model. Explanation about each topic is very clear. With respect to mathematical equations, all the models are neatly explained.",5,1,333
176,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is definitely a top-flight course and supremely useful!  I learned many new things about practical applications of recurrent neural networks in this class and found the natural language emphasis to be very useful, particularly for certain problems I have been working on for some time!  Professor Ng's lectures are very well-organized and clear and follow a very logical sequence.  The assignments, especially the programming assignments, are well designed and do a very good job of building upon what is taught in the lectures and add a great deal of value to this class.  I especially like the fact that we worked so much with Keras, which is an important framework for building Deep Learning systems and which is so widely used (it is the framework I often use in my own projects), and I acquired a lot of new knowledge about Keras thanks to this course.  Overall, it was a superb learning experience, and I will be recommending this to both friends and colleagues.",5,1,973

178,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"During the past couple of months, I worked on this Deep Learning Course Specialization Course by deeplearning.ai (through Coursera). I think is a great course for everyone that is interested in learning more about this topic and not only the theoretical aspects but also from a practical point of view. Andrew NG does an excellent work by going through the theory and then leaving some time for the practical exercises which are the best and, at the same time, the most challenging part of this specialization. These exercises start with very basic stuff but quickly turn into interesting problems related to convolutional neural networks, face recognition and end up with sequence algorithms for natural language processing.

As ligações semânticas e contexto das orações e palavras são tornadas inputs matematicamente convertidas em tensores. Para procurar seu correspondente sentido e significado esses tensores são reconvertidos em um processo complexo envolvendo várias etapas e fases. Na saída dos pipelines de algoritmos vc encontrará  sentido e significado, que possam traduzir para outra língua ou até mesmo dar respostas e por fim, conversar de forma natural. No mecanismo de atenção você aprenderá como programar seus dispositivos de monitoração de ambientes que possam entregar informação concreta sobre o que está acontecendo.",5,1,766
181,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It was an amazing course. From the beginning to the end, Andrew Ng has laid out all of the parts of the course extremely well. Of course, given the nature of RNNs and their complexity, it will also take your effort to make sure that you understand what he is talking about. Another note about the assignments, previous reviews have mentioned some of the problems and how the previous courses had better structured assignments. I think that the deeplearning.ai team has done a tremendous job of improving the content of this course assignments. At moments, it feels like you are lost, but deep explanations make sure that you understand everything and are able to implements all of the parts of the system that you have to implement. Please take this course!  ",5,1,759
182,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I like the way Andrew introduce the topic. From the easier cases to the more difficult ones.,5,1,92
183,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great topics and discussion, however the lectures started to gloss over the details of implementation which were left entirely to the exercises.",5,1,144
184,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I learned what this course says it to be. There are many interesting topics and new ways to do things. This course is quite advanced. If you have been in similar fields you may find a lot of connection, such as, time encoding in the transformer networks. You will learn how to incorporate time axis, time dependency, auto-correlation (you name it) to formulation of a machine learning problem using neural networks. I highly recommend this course if you need a systematic treatment of recent advances in speech recognition, machine translation, natural language processing, and more. The padding and blank words also are interesting way to pre-process or post-process. You will earn a lot of bells and whistles too. ",5,1,716
185,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great introduction to sequence models! Andrew as usual goes into detail on some seminal architectures that have shaped deep learning sequence models over the past ~decade. 

One feedback: I wish there was a week dedicated to doing just backprop and gradient computations for plain RNNs as well as LSTM-cell based RNNs. The latter is covered to some degree in the programming assignment as an ungraded part, but I don't think that is enough justice to the topic.

Also, another feedback: sometimes keeping track of the dimensions of the various entities in play was very difficult for me. Perhaps 10-15 minutes dedicated to explaining just that would be helpful to students.

All in all, a fantastic course though!",5,1,713
186,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It was an unbelievable journey through this Deep Learning Specialization! I really felt the power of the tools I obtained during the past 3 weeks that it took me to pass all 5 courses of the specialization. Many of the Programming Assignments are demanding and in the end I could be extremely satisfied that I succeeded in taking them all. Thanks a lot to Andrew Ng and all involved for making this sequence of courses accessible to people like me, and presenting it in such an understandable and interesting way! Now, I can start thinking of the vast potential for using Deep Neural Networks not only in Research and Space Sciences, where my interests are, but also in my daily life. Very many thanks again! AJ",5,1,711
187,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The whole series was excellent but in particular this last course on RNNs. Thank you for not skipping the mathematical details and letting us figure out backpropagations through time and how Adam works under the hood and explaining LSTMs and Attention so well. There was even a notebook on Attention! And the dinosaurus notebook was cool but the jazz improvisation really blew me away: the music actually sounded really nice! :) Also, thank you for pre-training the models to safe us time and teach us how to resume training from learned weights! The quizzes were helpful in developing an intuition and the price point was more than fair. Perfect series, Andrew, thanks a lot!",5,1,676
188,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Another excellent course, well presented, with compelling content.  My only concerns are regarding the labs.   With no previous Python or Keras experience, I found I needed to spend a lot of time coming up to speed on new programming domains in order to complete the assignments (my previous experience is mainly C).   While this was somewhat an issue in the previous courses in the Specialization, I found it particularly so in Sequence Models.  This distracted from the main objective of understanding the core NN algorithms.   I would recommend either: 1) advising students to have a solid background in Python, or 2) a bit more clarity on how to use the Keras functions in the labs.",5,1,686
188,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very good course. In quite short time you get understanding of a lot of principles and intuitions. The pace is good, explanations are consistent and clear, top-down approach from generic to specific, from simple to complex, very good instructional videos and interesting projects",5,1,279
189,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Previously, I have taken online classes before in Machine Learning by going the cheap route (Udemy, blogs, youtube) and you get what you pay for. Andrew Ng explains it the most thorough, easiest, and simplest way possible.  Presentation material is very understandable. Great class for new machine learning learners. Highly recommend it. The only downside is that the programming exercises are little too easy in my opinion. I feel like the best way to get your hands dirty is to do actual projects (do your own projects). These lectures are good for intuition and background of different types of Neural Network architectures. Other than that, Great material. Thanks Andrew!",5,1,675
190,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A very good course. It presented gated units like GRU and LSTM with so much simplicity that anyone can understand it on the first run. The downsides were the Jazz music generation, since it was the only task where the data is non intuitive (MIDI files) so you black-box apply the algorithm to a data you have no idea how it is structured, unless, of course, you are familiar with MIDI files prior to this course. Other than that, the learning curve was a bit slower in the beginning, but explodes by the end of the course, where you put all the subjects you've learned to perform a neural machine translation, which, in my opinion, was hugely awesome and rewarding.",5,1,665
191,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Like all other course in this specialization, this is also indeed a great course. It fundamentally clears concepts and gives very clear concpts for topics such as RNN and LSTM, which can ohterwise can be difficult to digest. Also, the programming excersices, built on great topics, suh as Music synthesis, Trigger word activation, are exciting to work on. The only feedback I would like to suggest, is that topics of Backpropogation for sequence model is critical and should have been taken up indepth in study rather than left to excerciss only. Overall this course is more fast paced and packed 3 weeks which should have been perhaps a 4 week course.",5,1,652
192,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course teaches in-depth knowledge of sequence models in natural language processing and speech regocnition . The programming excercises and the quizzes provide more content to furthur your grasp on the matter . The progamming exercises being totally in Keras , provides a clear analogy of how LSTM s and GRU s , work along with attention models introduced in the last week. You also have to implement  a LSTM and RNN from scratch in Numpy , which provides for the basic knowledge how these architectures actually work. Overall , it was a great experience and taking this course should be a pre-requisite for all learning in NLP. ",5,1,634
193,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Whew! This was very interesting and challenging. I have a huge backlog of things I need to go back and read up on and better understand. I really appreciate the work that Andrew and his team put into these courses.  The lectures were very well paced and clear. His temperament is exemplary for a teacher and his subject knowledge comes across.  I found the exercises really well thought out and beautifully crafted. The coding style could not have been more clear and the consistency made it understandable despite the complexity of the subject and the limited time to delve into the mechanics of Keras and the Python tools. Bravo!,5,1,631
194,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The last course is in this series does not disappoint. I found this course to be more difficult than the others; likely because I had very little prior exposure to recurrent neural networks. However, this course is worth the effort as it opens up a realm of new possibilities; text, audio & time-series data. Whether you need to detect, classify or translate sequences, or even generate new sequences in the vein of some examples, this course is for you. There are several high-level APIs for performing these tasks but having a deeper understanding of what these APIs are doing is invaluable to your success. Take this course.",5,1,627
195,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"An extremely well thought off and comprehensive introduction to sequence models, with examples taken from the most important/interesting application domains. Andrew NG's clarity of exposition is absolutely wonderful on such an otherwise complex area. The assignments are very cleverly chosen and helped me to finally get to grips with Keras. This being a new course, the assignment notebooks had a few minor issues that are well known by now and documented in forums and erratas, and will likely be fixed in subsequent reruns. Nevertheless, given the breadth and quality of the content, 5 starts are absolutely well deserved.",5,1,625

Again, pay close attention to the hints given in the programming exercises. If you don't follow, check the Discussion Forums to get a hint. Professor Andrew, your teaching is absolutely sublime - Crisp and concise. Personally, I would have loved an entire week dedicated to Attention Models as the entire concept seemed a bit rushed. Other than that, I have absolutely no qualms! For the people who are enrolling for THIS course only - make sure you're pretty good with Python and Keras.",5,1,617

206,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This a the last and the most anticipated course for me. It's hard, informative and most useful. I've got chance to learn some popular and powerful methods within the years, like word embedding and attention mechanism. I start to understand the way deep learning community deal with NLP, i.e., ingenious design of network structure inspired by the pattern human beings perceive the world. It doesn't enjoy solid foundation as statistical learning does, but is works and suitable for engineering. That's astonishing! I hope I can combine deep learning with traditional methods to better understand NLP.",5,1,600

239,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thank you for this wonderful sequence of courses! This whole concept is still a bit blurry for me, but as a lot of people during the interview have mentioned, one must simply exercise new skills to understand the technology. ",5,1,225
240,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,It's great course to get concepts right and overview. It will be great if you add further programming assignments(other than partially coded ones)  or resources as such where one can practice what he had learned as optional.,5,1,224

293,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The Sequence Models course covers state-of-the-art deep learning methodology as of 2018. The instructor is awesome. The assignments help solidify concepts presented in lecture videos. One nitpicking comment. This course, being relatively new, was less polished compared to the other courses in Deep Learning Specialization. I'm sure future updates will eliminate glitches and errors in the near future.",5,1,402
294,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Good course to help you understand how sequence models work and how to apply them for various problems.

299,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course assignments were very interesing and engaging - clearly a lot of time has been invested in them.  The quizzes were not easy but also not too difficult.  The combined quizzes/assignnments helped reinforce the lectures.     As always, the lectures were great.  Perhaps one improvement would be to allocate another week for the transformers as this material was not as well explored.",5,1,391
300,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It's a great class, and Andrew Ng is a great instructor. I wish the exercises were a bit harder. Since the course is aimed at all and I am coming from a graduate degree in the sciences, I realize it's hard to cater to all educational backgrounds. I would have liked to see optional/honors exercises to get us more involved. Other than that, I loved the class. Thanks so much for teaching it.",5,1,391
301,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I think the course and specialization are special. It requires a lot of hours to finish it. It can be a great review of specific topics in the deep learning subject. Thank you for allowing us to reach those specific topics easily. Great content,5,1,244
302,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course explains the fundamentals of RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs in a very easy manner with plenty of illustrations and programming exercises.

336,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A succinct overview of a number of ideas in sequence models. Some of these were covered in an NYU course I took 4 years ago (embeddings, LSTM), others I had heard about but hadn't had a chance to look into (attention). The assignments were set up to be pretty easy, but I think trying to do them from scratch rather than by filling in code would make for a pretty good project.",5,1,377
337,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It is a well designed course (especially for week 1 - week 2) which gave a comprehensive view of the sequence model. However, week 5 material can be better and clearer. To be specific, additional hints can be given in the coding exercise. Video can be better aligned with the material in the coding exercise.  Thank you Andrew and all the contributors for this amazing course!",5,1,376
338,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great introduction to sequence models/RNNs. The real-world examples were very illuminating. Again, as with the previous course in the specialization, I felt some details of how to run/predict NNs using keras were lacking, which could leave a student floundering if they've never used keras before. This is in contrast to some other, much easier, tasks where hints were given.",5,1,375
339,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Out of 5 courses offered I think this was the most exciting one as it combines everything learnt so far and teaches how to combine different NN modeling techniques to achieve desired classification/prediction features .

The only minor comment that I add is that Andrew should include some links for further reading (along the courses for each topic or theme). I know that anyone can quickly look up for them in the Internet (and they can be outdated) but that would make the specialization even better in my opinion.,5,1,364
348,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is Course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization, and the last one. We learn Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) /Sequence Model, which allow translation or trigger word (like ""Hey Siri!""). It's a completely different beast than CNN seen in Course 4. Again, nice videos and explanations, and well-designed useful programming assignment (TensorFlow/Keras and numpy)",5,1,363
349,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:," I Highly recommended this course on Sequence Models. The course is easy to follow as it gradually moves from the basics to more advanced topics, building gradually. Andrew Sir makes the cocepts behind the scenes about LSTM GRU etc very easy to understand. Assignments are great, extremely well designed.

I learned many new things about practical applications of recurrent neural networks in this class and found the natural language emphasis to be very useful, particularly for certain problems I have been working on for some time!  Professor Ng's lectures are very well-organized and clear and follow a very logical sequence.  The assignments, especially the programming assignments, are well designed and do a very good job of building upon what is taught in the lectures and add a great deal of value to this class.  I especially like the fact that we worked so much with Keras, which is an important framework for building Deep Learning systems and which is so widely used (it is the framework I often use in my own projects), and I acquired a lot of new knowledge about Keras thanks to this course.  Overall, it was a superb learning experience, and I will be recommending this to both friends and colleagues.",5,1,973

Can't wait to see what enhancements they made,",5,1,321
374,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The topics covered in this course were a bit on the advanced side. The technologies used are most frequently used in the area of NLP. The course helps understand the basic concepts of NLP like word vectors and embedding, at the same time explains the very complex concepts like LSTM, GRUs and Attention models very well. ",5,1,321
375,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was an excellent course to learn about sequence models.  We were able to not only examine standard RNN structufre, but GRUs, LSTMs, and Dr. Ng included the most recent innovation in the field by adding in study of Transformes.

385,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Awesome. But the programming assignments need to be less erroneous and lectures and assignments could contain more technical and mathematical details to build the foundations. The programming assignments could be designed to allow the students to do more that spoonfeeding.,5,1,273
386,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was for me the best course on the deeplearning.ai series since I am a complete novice regarding sequence models. Nonetheless, I have managed to learn a lot and the material was very good (with often state of the art techniques). The assignments were excellent as well! ",5,1,274
387,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I really liked this last course as I did not have much experience with NLP and with audio in general, as I did have with computer vision and image processing.

394,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"During the past couple of months, I worked on this Deep Learning Course Specialization Course by deeplearning.ai (through Coursera). I think is a great course for everyone that is interested in learning more about this topic and not only the theoretical aspects but also from a practical point of view. Andrew NG does an excellent work by going through the theory and then leaving some time for the practical exercises which are the best and, at the same time, the most challenging part of this specialization. These exercises start with very basic stuff but quickly turn into interesting problems related to convolutional neural networks, face recognition and end up with sequence algorithms for natural language processing.

397,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"It was an amazing course. From the beginning to the end, Andrew Ng has laid out all of the parts of the course extremely well. Of course, given the nature of RNNs and their complexity, it will also take your effort to make sure that you understand what he is talking about. Another note about the assignments, previous reviews have mentioned some of the problems and how the previous courses had better structured assignments. I think that the deeplearning.ai team has done a tremendous job of improving the content of this course assignments. At moments, it feels like you are lost, but deep explanations make sure that you understand everything and are able to implements all of the parts of the system that you have to implement. Please take this course!  ",5,1,759

399,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great topics and discussion, however the lectures started to gloss over the details of implementation which were left entirely to the exercises.",5,1,144
400,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I learned what this course says it to be. There are many interesting topics and new ways to do things. This course is quite advanced. If you have been in similar fields you may find a lot of connection, such as, time encoding in the transformer networks. You will learn how to incorporate time axis, time dependency, auto-correlation (you name it) to formulation of a machine learning problem using neural networks. I highly recommend this course if you need a systematic treatment of recent advances in speech recognition, machine translation, natural language processing, and more. The padding and blank words also are interesting way to pre-process or post-process. You will earn a lot of bells and whistles too. ",5,1,716
401,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great introduction to sequence models! Andrew as usual goes into detail on some seminal architectures that have shaped deep learning sequence models over the past ~decade. 

One feedback: I wish there was a week dedicated to doing just backprop and gradient computations for plain RNNs as well as LSTM-cell based RNNs. The latter is covered to some degree in the programming assignment as an ungraded part, but I don't think that is enough justice to the topic.

Also, another feedback: sometimes keeping track of the dimensions of the various entities in play was very difficult for me. Perhaps 10-15 minutes dedicated to explaining just that would be helpful to students.

All in all, a fantastic course though!",5,1,713
402,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the course from start to end!

I really felt the power of the tools I obtained during the past 3 weeks that it took me to pass all 5 courses of the specialization. Many of the Programming Assignments are demanding and in the end I could be extremely satisfied that I succeeded in taking them all. Thanks a lot to Andrew Ng and all involved for making this sequence of courses accessible to people like me, and presenting it in such an understandable and interesting way! Now, I can start thinking of the vast potential for using Deep Neural Networks not only in Research and Space Sciences, where my interests are, but also in my daily life. Very many thanks again!

Thank you for not skipping the mathematical details and letting us figure out backpropagations through time and how Adam works under the hood and explaining LSTMs and Attention so well. There was even a notebook on Attention! And the dinosaurus notebook was cool but the jazz improvisation really blew me away: the music actually sounded really nice! :) Also, thank you for pre-training the models to safe us time and teach us how to resume training from learned weights! The quizzes were helpful in developing an intuition and the price point was more than fair. Perfect series, Andrew, thanks a lot!",5,1,676
413,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Another excellent course, well presented, with compelling content.  My only concerns are regarding the labs.   With no previous Python or Keras experience, I found I needed to spend a lot of time coming up to speed on new programming domains in order to complete the assignments (my previous experience is mainly C).   While this was somewhat an issue in the previous courses in the Specialization, I found it particularly so in Sequence Models.  This distracted from the main objective of understanding the core NN algorithms.   I would recommend either: 1) advising students to have a solid background in Python, or 2) a bit more clarity on how to use the Keras functions in the labs.",5,1,686
414,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Previously, I have taken online classes before in Machine Learning by going the cheap route (Udemy, blogs, youtube) and you get what you pay for. Andrew Ng explains it the most thorough, easiest, and simplest way possible.  Presentation material is very understandable. Great class for new machine learning learners. Highly recommend it. The only downside is that the programming exercises are little too easy in my opinion. I feel like the best way to get your hands dirty is to do actual projects (do your own projects). These lectures are good for intuition and background of different types of Neural Network architectures. Other than that, Great material. Thanks Andrew!",5,1,675
415,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A very good course. It presented gated units like GRU and LSTM with so much simplicity that anyone can understand it on the first run. The downsides were the Jazz music generation, since it was the only task where the data is non intuitive (MIDI files) so you black-box apply the algorithm to a data you have no idea how it is structured, unless, of course, you are familiar with MIDI files prior to this course. Other than that, the learning curve was a bit slower in the beginning, but explodes by the end of the course, where you put all the subjects you've learned to perform a neural machine translation, which, in my opinion, was hugely awesome and rewarding.",5,1,665
416,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Like all other course in this specialization, this is also indeed a great course. It fundamentally clears concepts and gives very clear concpts for topics such as RNN and LSTM, which can ohterwise can be difficult to digest. Also, the programming excersices, built on great topics, suh as Music synthesis, Trigger word activation, are exciting to work on. The only feedback I would like to suggest, is that topics of Backpropogation for sequence model is critical and should have been taken up indepth in study rather than left to excerciss only. Overall this course is more fast paced and packed 3 weeks which should have been perhaps a 4 week course.",5,1,652
417,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course teaches in-depth knowledge of sequence models in natural language processing and speech regocnition . The programming excercises and the quizzes provide more content to furthur your grasp on the matter . The progamming exercises being totally in Keras , provides a clear analogy of how LSTM s and GRU s , work along with attention models introduced in the last week. You also have to implement  a LSTM and RNN from scratch in Numpy , which provides for the basic knowledge how these architectures actually work. Overall , it was a great experience and taking this course should be a pre-requisite for all learning in NLP. ",5,1,634

I have a huge backlog of things I need to go back and read up on and better understand. I really appreciate the work that Andrew and his team put into these courses.  The lectures were very well paced and clear. His temperament is exemplary for a teacher and his subject knowledge comes across.  I found the exercises really well thought out and beautifully crafted. The coding style could not have been more clear and the consistency made it understandable despite the complexity of the subject and the limited time to delve into the mechanics of Keras and the Python tools.

419,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The last course is in this series does not disappoint. I found this course to be more difficult than the others; likely because I had very little prior exposure to recurrent neural networks. However, this course is worth the effort as it opens up a realm of new possibilities; text, audio & time-series data. Whether you need to detect, classify or translate sequences, or even generate new sequences in the vein of some examples, this course is for you.

I've got chance to learn some popular and powerful methods within the years, like word embedding and attention mechanism. I start to understand the way deep learning community deal with NLP, i.e., ingenious design of network structure inspired by the pattern human beings perceive the world. It doesn't enjoy solid foundation as statistical learning does, but is works and suitable for engineering. That's astonishing! I hope I can combine deep learning with traditional methods to better understand NLP.",5,1,600

For someone with not much experience in DL, they were pretty close to perfect: I felt I was not left to fend for myself, yet they were not overly simple and forced me to solidify what was thought in the lectures and learn better. Thank You Andrew and team!",5,1,597
426,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I have been through wonderful journey of learning and implementing deep learning from very scratch.

427,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Lots and Lots of knowledge and experience in 3-weeks of class. In Machine Learning terms, this course maximizes the knowledge and experience gained with sequence models by minimizing the time required to complete the course. Lecture videos are very intuitive while assignment projects are very real-world centric.",5,1,313
428,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"As always one of the best courses offer by coursera and it was a hell of a ride. I learned about many things like RNN,sequence model,GRU,LSTM,word triggered,word sampling,translation using deep learning algorithm . Andrew did a fantastic job and keep everything simple so that everything can be understandable.",5,1,310
429,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Really good choice of topics, including state of the art tools like attention and word embeddings. Very useful, especially for those interested in Language Processing applications. However, the videos and assignments need some more careful editing, because there are occasional mistakes, lazy explanations etc.",5,1,310
430,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very great and aspiring course, I learned lots of concepts in this course. I think It would be better If there was a capstone project for the final course of deep learning specialization. It was very great but If I had the opportunity of implementing a project from zero to 100, It would be more than great... ",5,1,310
431,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course, though not as awesome as other Ng's courses. I think creators became a bit tired closer to the last course in specialization. Anyway, fantastic courses, fantastic specialization, fantastic professor! Thank you very much!! Looking forward to new courses - maybe Reinforcement Learning, GANs? =)",5,1,307
432,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Leave it up to Mr. Andrew Ng to explain complex concepts in a very much intuitive manner. The guy is a world apart when it comes to explaining complex concepts. No other MOOC even comes close. Absolutely highly recommended.,5,1,223
433,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course by Prof Ng. I had taken his Machine Learning course a 
few years ago, so expected high standards of content and assignment 
preparation - I was not disappointed. Staff is very responsive and 
helpful in forums as well. I highly recommend it. Taken as part of the 
DeepLearning specialization.",5,1,305
434,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I loved this course as wel, I had a little bit less time to advance as steadily as I did with previous courses.

The programming exercises are very helpful to enhance the understanding of these models.",5,1,302
437,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course content is very good. This course seemed a little bit harder than other previous courses. There is lots of improvement opportunities for Coursera's Lab (Jypeter notebooks), every now and then it does not work i.e. cant submit the assignment, it's very very slow, its just not up to the mark.",5,1,302
438,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,A very well organized introduction to the wonderland of Recurrent Neural Networks.

The awesome programming assignments with excellent documentation is a highlight! ,5,1,302
439,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"With this course it's possible to conclude that recurrent neural networks are the most powerful variant of neural networks. Used in a many places, this course expleains ingishtfully how they work, what's the math behind them, and how different implementations function for different areas of research.",5,1,301
440,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Andrew Ng knows how to make people understand the problem, architect a solution and then map it to data. He does it very well. I am going to repeat his course again as I still believe there is something that I have missed and I need to follow him thoroughly. I want to understand and process like him.",5,1,301
441,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"overall it is another great course, clear explain on the RNN, LSTM, GRU, etc. really like the assignment to implement RNN from scratch. assignments related to Keras needs ""googling"" outside resources, and there is still some keras homework to be done in order to fully understand the assignment code. ",5,1,301
442,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Thank you very much instructors. I learnt both fundamentals of deep learning and application of them in simple and efficient way.

445,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A very good course to learn the fundamentals of Sequence models. It contain a lot of important developments of the sequence models and together with the programming assignments, it makes easier to learn. I found this course very easy to follow and understand the theories. I highly recommend this.",5,1,297
446,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I have always found difficult how RNN and LSTM works as theretically I was not getting a clear picture how it was working .The programming assignments helped clear my doubts and I got a clear understanding to a lot of extent how this mechanism is working and how it is useful in speech synthesis.,5,1,296
447,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course introduces the basic idea of RNN, GRU and LSTM models. They are obviously harder than the CNN models and the concepts are not so easy to understand. Thanks to the systematic introduction! Together wit the excises I can understand better the theory from the applications. It's great!",5,1,294
448,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The content, examples, assignments, and quizzes are thoroughly developed. All the courses of the specialization share the same notation and lead a student from basic concepts to complex ones helping to develop an intuition on each step. The best course on topic of Deep Learning one could find.",5,1,294
449,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,It was a great experience to learn from Andrew NG and it helped a lot to me personally and professionally.

451,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great finish to the specialisation. I have learned a lot of the core details of how to proceed with my own Deep Learning projects. My one piece of feedback would be for an intermediary step, that requires more of the programming myself, as a lot of the intricate coding has already been done.",5,1,292
452,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great selection of topics, clear explanations from Dr. Ng, and coding exercises to allow the understanding of the topics. Perhaps I would have liked to see some Time series analysis in the Sequential Networks parts, but even though, it was a great course.
Thank you Dr. Ng and all your team!",5,1,291
453,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The course content is very good but the mistakes in the videos are being mentioned after the video. This is making us get confused a bit. It would be good if those errors are mentioned before the video itself so that we can look into that before watching the video and get prepared for that. ,5,1,292
454,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Excellent teaching, materials, and organization! It's great to include state-of-the-art technologies like Transformer and LSTM.

462,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Fantastic course! Presents both the theory and practical uses in a straightforward manner that is easy to grasp. Programming assignments are a mix of NumPy and Keras API, with the former being more illustrative of the inner workings of RNNs and the latter being more practically useful.",5,1,286
462,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course! It teaches the necessary to implement deep neural networks problems and give you practical advice. You can go deeper as you want in the material of this course, the programming assignments can be extended by going into the optional content. ",5,1,255
463,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Excellent! Amazing! Such good quality of lecture and assignments. Thank you Andrew and team for giving me such a good overview of what i can use this for. I feel as though this series dramatically lowered the barriers to entry for me to get started on any ML project i decide to. Thanks,5,1,286
464,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,No better introductory material. I suggest doing NLP specialization by deeplearning.ai after this though I have still not tried it out myself yet but hoping to do it some time. Thank you Andrew! I got emotional in your last video of the course. You are such an example for educators <3,5,1,285

475,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,the programing assignment ins WEEK 1 was a bit ambiguous in nature. helped me improve my debugging skills. ,5,1,107
476,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,More easier to understand than the ConvNets course!,5,1,51
477,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is a great course. It provides a good introduction to RNNs and how they are used in sequence modeling. Introduction to GRU, LSTMs, BiRNNs, attention model is great way to learn these in depth. The exercises are designed to make you familiar with the internals of these layers.",5,1,281
478,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Having done the previous courses or not, this course will teach a whole lot about the past, present and future of NLP. At the end, as Prof. Andrew Ng has said, one can feel proud about how easily a topic can be explained with the help of just one slide. ",5,1,254
479,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"The course teaches the fundamentals of NLP, traditional and modern approaches to solving NLP problems. It starts with the basics and go pretty advance. I highly recommend this course especially if you want to significantly improve your knowledge in AI. ",5,1,253
480,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was the last course of specialization and it was a great journey. Thank you Sir Andrew NG for making such a wonderful course.

485,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course, as always, de-mystifies a quite complicated topic and gives very good intuition why the models work. For example, LSTM is very complicated unit but Andrew illustrates well what it tries to achieve. That said, this is a very tough course.",5,1,250
486,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,I can't thank Andrew Sir and Coursera enough for enabling me with this wealth of knowledge in NLP. With this I can dive deeper into NLP and look at a career change as well into this area. The course has immensly boosted not only my knowledge but also my confidence. Much obliged.,5,1,279
487,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"At the beginning this is very counter-intuitive. But later on when I am on the final assignment, I finally realized that we are not focusing on gradient descent, but architecture building and training set assembling!  When everything start to make sense, it is really intriguing.",5,1,279
488,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course made me have great understanding around the Sequence Models such as GRU, LSTM, Attention, etc. I had a lot of fun while completing programming exercises such as Trigger word detection. As always, it was one of the best class ever. Thanks Professor Andrew Ng and all-!",5,1,279
490,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This course is one of the best course we can take for deep learning.The quiz assignment was good.The programming assignment was easy to understand many functions which i find it difficult in videos.Overall the instructor Andrew Ng lecture was good,5,1,247
491,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,This course covers a lot of ground and provides many opportunities to practice the concepts.  I just wish there were one or two (possibly optional/honors ) assignments with fewer walk through instructions so one could test one's learning for real.,5,1,247
492,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was very cool, RNNs seem very powerful. I don't think the programming exercises were the best to get some experience but I really like the way Andrew explains the algorithms. Still 5*",5,1,188
493,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This course is a nice introduction to neural networks applied to sequence models. It has interesting applications in natural language processing and speech recognition. It would have been nice to apply the concepts to time series prediction, too. ",5,1,247
494,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This is a pretty cool course to work on introduction of NLP. A blend of practical and theoritical aspects included though there are black boxes (I felt Convolutional Course to be more effective though, maybe because of my background, but still!!)",5,1,246
495,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"I don't know why this course has not been rated more than the other courses of this specialization.  In my opinion,  this is the best course among all the others. All thanks to Andrew Sir and Coursera team to introduce me to this specialization. ",5,1,246
496,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,The course is very helpful in learning the important concepts of RNN in a very easy way.  The instructor has a very unique style of teaching which makes the typical concepts easy and at the same the makes you develop your interest in the course.,5,1,245
497,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Andrew Ng and the team have created a fantastic opportunity to learn the basics of Deep Learning Algorithms.

499,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Great course teaching state-of-the art NLP technologies. I wish the attention notebook could be improved, and the projects could get more flexible and in-depth. I also wish there could be a Keras tutorial that gives an overview of the framework.",5,1,245
500,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Andrew Ng is a fantastic instructor. His ability  to break down  a complicated concept like neural networks and deep learning so that a non-math, non computer person  like me actually understands the underlying mechanisms is quite extraordinary.",5,1,245
501,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Very effective mix of theory and practical examples, cemented by practice exercises in form of the programming assignments.  The guided instructions of the programming assignments are as valuable as the lectures.  I would recommend putting the ""errata"" readings *before* the videos containing the errors (as was done in an earlier course).  I also notice that some quiz questions pick up on nuances that were quite underplayed in the lectures, but going back over my notes, did find them.",5,1,488
502,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,Smooth and hands-on walkthrough of basics of NLP and speech recognition. The flow of the course is very well-designed.,5,1,118
503,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Amazing course overall. Prof Ng's diagrams are the clearest explanations of DL models I have found anywhere and it's that clear a ton of thought went into planning the notations. The assignments are exciting and surprisingly fun. One could say that there is a little too much handholding throughout the assignments, but I understand that this course is more about the heuristics. Again, it's fantastic course overall and the resources provided throughout are truly unique to Coursera! ",5,1,485
504,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This was my first AI course and I really made significant progress in my understanding of foundations of deep learning with this. Thanks to Professor Andrew's very informative course videos, grasping the complex concepts became possible.

I thought about giving up because I wasn't able to learn, so, in May of this year 2020, Coursera opened its courses to undergraduates. I do not thought twice, at the same hour that I knew that news about free courses, I began this. Then, after that time I want to thank to Professor Ng and all colaborators on that site. One day I will be one of student of Professor Andrew Ng in Stanford. ",5,1,464
511,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A greatly knowledgeable course! I learned a lot about Natural Language Processing and explored RNNs, LSTMs, Word Embeddings, Seq2Seq Models, Attention Mechanism, etc. The course focuses more on the concepts along with providing the essential math. It was fun to implement Language Models, Neural Machine Translation & Speech Recognition. I would surely recommend this course to the ones who are diving into the world of NLP, and need a perfect introduction to it.",5,1,463
512,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"A very systematic and well structured specialization course on deep learning by Andrew and team.

Coming from zero backgrond of Deep learning to now being confident of using the concepts in my fututure research work, i would like to thank coursera and team Andrew for such a wonderful specialization.",5,1,460
513,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"Another very good course, though not without its failings. Mainly, the Transformers' lectures and programming assignment were confusing and didn't go into enough depth to deliver the intuition.",5,1,193
514,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:,"This end course is a little more  complicated than the previous ones, especially in programming homework. However,  it also inherits the merits of the special, gives learners the basic framework of sequence models. What impresses me most is the lesson of ""Debiasing word embeddings"", it shows that AI could be designed to do more against human stale thoughts, which sets up a  good principle for designing AI. Yes, it should be taught to new learners of AI.",5,1,457

2549,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Note: this review also applies to the specialization as a whole. I thoroughly enjoyed the courses and learnt so much. The content delivery was excellent. I am not sure how unfeasible it was to re-produce the videos, though it would have been nice to see fewer corrections. In regards to the programming assignments, I think that they are great overall. The way the code was mostly pre-filled to ensure logical workflow helped me to stay on track rather than trying to skip straight to the final model (I assume beginner programmers do this a lot). It provided a great template for thought and I will definitely be referring back regularly. However, I also think that descriptions and exercises could be integrated better, especially in the later assignments where students are compiling more complex models and prior skills in programming (from earlier courses) are expected. Specifically, there are certain Exercise descriptions with multiple parts 1a,b,c 2a,b,c etc and hints before you even get to the start of the actual implementation. I think this is inefficient and was a bit frustrating at times. It felt a bit disjointed and overwhelming to read the instructions without no context (i.e. reading about step 2c before implementing step 1a). On the whole, I know that the knowledge, understanding and skills I obtained through this specialization will serve me extremely well throughout my PhD. Thank you very much.",4,1,1422
2550,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I enjoyed Prof Ng's excellent lectures, but felt the material moved too quickly.  This 3-week course could easily have been extended to (say) 5 weeks to allow for more depth in covering the various RNNs, applications and model details. ",4,1,236
2551,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"While I loved listening to Andrew Ng's lectures and I find him very lucid in his presentation and pedagogy, I feel that the practical aspect has suffered -by giving enough hints on how to solve the programming exercises, the challenge is reduced. There were quite a few issues I also faced when connecting to the server which resulted in rewriting the code a couple of times (in hindsight, I should have always made a local copy and tested it before submitting it). I would rather that each of these courses becomes a 2 month course (much like Stanfords convolutional networks course) so that the practical aspect is also given equal weightage. While presenting the lectures, Prof Andrew Ng could also lay it out how you would implement in a particular framework like tensorflow and there should be enough exercises that walk a person through them before attempting the programming exercises.",4,1,892
2552,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course has great material on sequence models, presented with the usual energy and enthusiasm that Andrew Ng brings to every course.  The model diagrams are great for visualizing what's actually going on in the complex assignments, and the assignments are generally designed with 1) additional code and commentary to make the examples informative and 2) the ""guard rails"" (e.g., insert code here, with related hints)  to clarify the specific lines to edit.  Having said that, I feel that the assignments were a little less polished/refined relative to earlier courses in the concentration, and I spent significantly more time in the discussion forums than I had in prior courses.  I also recommend investing in additional training in Keras and Tensor Flow as a prerequisite or in parallel to this course to help get the most out of the practical applications of the material.",4,1,879
2553,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As i progressed through the specialization i liked the content less for the following 3 reasons. 1) With the exception of the first course there are no in-video questions which would help learn/exercise on the spot. There could easily have been one question per 3-4 minutes of video content. 2) The programming exercises although useful, became more disconnected from the lectures as the specialization progressed- ie they focused on keras documentation which could have been accompanied by a lecture video dedicated to that goal (as in the second course with tensor flow). The result was that I just tried to get through the programming exercises in courses 4 and especially 5 without understanding much of what I was doing. 3) There were too many errors in the lecture. Overall a good specialization but at least points 1 and 2 should be fixed  ",4,1,847
2554,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,this was a really interesting course.  Too bad the details of the math are not really there.,4,1,92
2555,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It is a good course and a very important one. However, I needed to mark it a bit lower than most other courses in this specialization because I felt sometimes confused with Keras. Navigating in such higher level of abstraction would require a stronger support for the Keras part. I believe we could have explored a bit further the sequence models and yet I was sometimes struggling understanding some basic Keras instructions. Perhaps it could be included an extra programming assignment tutorial (for Keras) or extend the existing Keras tutorial. ",4,1,548
2556,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,First of all I would like to convey my thanks to Andrew Sir for not only this course but for the whole specialization.You are fantastic teacher and I will try to pay you back by solving real world problems with the help of knowledge you have imparted.,4,1,251
2557,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"nice course as always! I need really thanks Andrew and team for this, it is very well structured & informative, provide good intuition and solid base for future self-learning of this area. ",4,1,189
2558,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall, I liked the Machine Learning Stanford class' programing assignments better than the one in the deep learning specialization. For me, coming up with a full implementation of a function (and then having it unit tested by the grader), is more conducive of learning and more entertaining than a step by step, line by line guidance, as we get in the Jupiter notebooks. That said the notebook themselves are incredibly well designed and put together. I love how Andrew Ng, beyond his stature, unmatched knowledge, and outstanding teaching skills, puts his whole heart to work. That makes the world of a difference to me and helps me do the same with others. Thank you for everything!",4,1,686
2559,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This was a VERY thorough overview of the machine learning architectures required to tackle a wide range of natural language processing problems. It's quite dense and I had to watch each lecture several times and break it down into chunks to avoid getting lost, but now that I'm finished there I feel like a lot of technology has been demystified. The assignments really hold your hand and mostly just test your ability to follow instructions with even a hazy understanding of the weekly concepts, so you shouldn't expect to graduate and then immediately build a machine translation system from the ground up, but I do feel very ready to dive into technical interviews.",4,1,668
2560,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This was a good course mainly on Recurrent Neaural Networks, including LSTMs, and Encoder/Decoder networks, and the Attention model. In the last week there a brief overview of the Transformer networks and a long exercise fleshing that out. This is an interesting combination of merging Recurrent Network and a convolution style network.",4,1,336

2562,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"A very helpful and enlightening course, though it felt a bit ""hand-wavy"" at times. It never really felt like we were getting the full story, like I was missing something the whole time. Word embeddings cleared up a lot, but the entire course was a lot of information to digest at once. Coming from an image processing background, most of the terminology was unfamiliar, and the programming assignments weren't quite as guided as previous ones.",4,1,443
2563,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I'm a fan of Andrew Ng's machine learning classes on Coursera. This was my least favorite. I'm not sure if it's because of the complexity of the material or that so much material is presented in a short time, but I feel that I'm not as confident about my knowledge of the material in this course compared to the earlier courses. In the last few assignments, I felt like I was mechanically plugging stuff in without really understanding the thought process. His teaching style seems much the same as the other courses though, so it's possible this could be due to me rather than the course.",4,1,589
2564,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I am grateful for the opportunity to have learned from an exceptional instructor, and one of the luminaries, in artificial intelligence. Insofar as this particular course is concerned, theory was well explained, as always. I feel like there was a bit of a disconnect in the implementations, though. Some of this was just the sheer challenge of using a still-unfamiliar platform (Keras). And, in concert with this latter point, some was due to a sort of ""fill in the blank"" approach to using the platform. Nonetheless, that I have learned, and learned a lot, is undeniable!",4,1,572
2565,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"a more intuitive materials been used while teaching would be helpful to more effieciently and enjoyably grasp the concepts. what i mean is that the description or the summary the lessons been taught in a week are in the corresponding week's assignments; those summarys were more clear and visually pleasing than the inclass presentation. for example, usage of pens for drawing networks and the likes can be migrated to better animations ,etc. the crux is that the content in the course is great, but it feels like there is a good scope for improvement in presentation.",4,1,568
2566,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Firstly, thank to the course instructors and Dr.Ng for teaching us deep learning. You are all a gem. I enjoyed this course, and how simple it made coding RNNs. However, I believe the concepts could be simplified some more, even in the form of a pseudocode or conceptual outline. This is my 3rd course from Andrew Ng, so I know he's skilled at distilling deep learning concepts with ease. Week 1 was the best for me as the operation of the LSTM, GRU RNNs were succinctly outlined and set a solid foundation , Week 2 could be presented a less abstract way though. ",4,1,562
2567,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I think with sequence models, the course details were very challenging. I strongly believe that do take a course in Deeplearning Specialization, one must at least learn Python from basics to advanced level. However, Andrew Ng has made it easy for a first time student with programming background to understand most of the concepts in this specialization. Thank you Deeplearning.ai for this course. I have learned some of the cutting-edge skills that can't be easily found anywhere. I have learned a skill that will set me apart from the crowd.",4,1,543
2568,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I really enjoyed this course. I'm not crazy about the fill-in-the-blank style of the programming assignments. I think I'd learn the material better if it just gave me the arguments and returns of the functions and forced me to write everything in between. I think it makes sense to emphasize keras in the later parts of this sequence, but I feel like I never got a basic introduction to how models in keras are supposed to be structured. Maybe there should be an assigned reading on this, if not a video or an optional programming assignment.",4,1,542
2569,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great content, and leaves me set to build systems making predictions for or conversions between sequences- particularly including text posts, which are an interest of mine.",4,1,172
2570,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I found the first week of this course a bit tough compared to all the other 4 courses in this specialization. Perhaps there should be one more week to give much more programming exerises to help understand the concepts clearly. But having said that, the last two weeks, especially the last one about hot-word, is very neatly done and provides very good understanding of such models are implemented. Overall satisfied. Thanks Andrew and team, I feel much more confident in my understanding of these terms and the concepts behind them.",4,1,533
2571,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I never been exposed to this subject Sequence Models before. I learned a lot from this course. But the materials is more advanced than all previous ones, especially the program exercises. The exercise guideline is helpful but not leave many guess works for students not well skilled in Python and Keras. I completed the program exercises by blindly trying different keras commands.

2648,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures were outstanding (as usual), but the programming assignments (except for the final Trigger Word assignment) were terrible.  I spent almost all my time trying to figure out Keras syntax, without ever having a Keras tutorial or anything.  If you are going to rely on Keras, you should probably add a tutorial or some references.  A lot of wasted time.  But other than that, this course was amazing.",4,1,409
2649,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good course. I liked the speech recognition part more. I found the assignments involving Keras code difficult to do in both RNN and CNN courses. Without the help of discussion forum i wouldn't have completed the Keras assignments. Thank you all the fellow students and mentors for your contributions to the discussion forum. Thank you so much Andrew and team for putting this awesome specialization :),4,1,406
2650,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As the other courses in this series, this is definitely another great course, and explains to details the various sequence models. I gave it 4 stars because I believe it might need some improvements. Compared to the previous courses it felt a little rushed, and had too much new information and long programming exercises for a single week. Maybe it would have been better if it was 4 weeks instead of 3.",4,1,404
2651,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Always a great course but I would expect to have more lessons on how to use Keras and Tensor Flow API in a better way for who needs to use them in real NLP applications. I still have some doubts on how to use them correctly (for example the use of time distributed layer in the last exercise 'trigger word detection' that we didn't use in the architecture for the exercise about attention mechanism),4,1,399
2652,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot. The descriptions of GRUs and LSTMs were a little scant, however, and I found myself rewatching the videos trying to get my head around them.

2659,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Another great course by Prof. Ng. The reason for 4 stars is that I found the assignments to gloss over a lot of new Keras ideas (for Keras beginners) at the expense of spending more time on how the ideas were being implemented. I think the course should be spread out over more weeks, say 5, and spend the extra time going into more depth around the Keras model architectures.",4,1,376

Only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that at this stage (April 2018), there are few knowledgeable mentors and virtually no Instructors present in the Forum. Course provides little introduction to the syntax of Keras, which makes for some problems implementing models.

Only minus is practical assignements which are too straightforward, it's helpfull to have guide what to do, but maybe some assignement which doesn't have too much of a guide could be good (not necessarily the one which is graded but something which makes you to think a little bit more rather than follow the tips and writing Python code).",4,1,460

Particularly liked the dinosaur names, emojify, the humour and positivity in the course: mentioning gender/racial bias, encouraging people to do good with their skills. Namaste!",4,1,431
2754,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good overall. Andrew Ng explains the material clearly and accessibly.,4,1,74
2755,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I thought the course and the specialization was great for people who want to get into the details of deep learning. Although I enjoyed learning about all the details, I wish there was a separate course specifically for Keras and TensorFlow. In practice, we will rarely have to implement the models from scratch, and having a better understanding of Keras and TensorFlow would be more helpful in terms of career prospects. ",4,1,422
2756,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This was hard to keep up with, maybe too hard. The assignments' difficulty also was on a different level then the lectures maybe there more time should be put into the lecture videos as it was the case for DNN and RNN.",4,1,218
2757,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The videos and programming exercises were very interesting and insightful. My only complain is some of notebooks for exercises include errors and it was just a time-wasting  task to find the ""trick"" to pass the grader.",4,1,218
2758,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The content is well captured and Andrew really helps build the required intuitions. But, the assignments are too guided. There is no room to struggle for solutions which often proves to be the main source of learning.",4,1,217
2759,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I think the transformer programming exercise of this fifth course is not as good as the others. The methods we must implement are not clearly explained and the research on these really took me a huge amount of time.,4,1,215
2760,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The exercises are too short and too basic for this course specifically. The task is a great learning experience but there is not much one would struggle with in terms of difficulty as there is too much spoon feeding.,4,1,216
2761,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great video lectures, but practical assignments are a pain due to awful auto-grading system and programming expirience in Jupyter in general. Most of the time you'll be searching for an error that isn't really there.",4,1,216

2766,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It is better to talk more about bi-directional RNN and give assightment about it before week three and week four. Moreover, it is also better to give two more weeks to talk more about the material in week 3 and 4.",4,1,213
2767,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Programming exercises did show you quite a bit, but got complex enough that most of my time was spent reading and understanding the preamble than doing any programming. That being said it delivered on the promise.",4,1,213
2768,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Course content is really good! However, I found it quite difficult to truly understand deep learning algorithms. However, it provides good glimpse of of sequence models and intuitions behind various useful models.",4,1,213
2769,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course and material, Andrew NG really know who to explain difficult subjects in an intuitive way. However, the course seems that it still needs some work (there are some bugs in the lectures and assignments)",4,1,213
2770,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures are suitable. Andrew, as always, is very clear and goes into necessary detail on each topic.",4,1,105

2780,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The lecture for Sequence model was good motivation to get interesting about text and audio processing. All of lectures were very fundamental and intuitive. Thank you very much. Prof. Ng.,4,1,186
2781,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good and fun course in the sequence. However, it would be very nice if there were some examples of using RNN for things such as self driving etc, outside the realm of speech and NLP",4,1,186
2782,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course videos are very good. However the optional parts of assignments have lots of issues and errors. Please update the assignment to reduce the time wasted unnecessarily debugging.,4,1,186
2783,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very interesting exercice and assignments from which a lot is to learn. Content quite complicated which will require from me to come back for review and deepen some points. Thank you !,4,1,184
2784,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It was necessary to study extensively the Keras framework to fulfill the code tasks. I suggest an extra module with small simple RNN modeling exercises to better adapt the framework.,4,1,182
2785,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall, I really like this module. One possible improvement might be providing more information for backpropagation. Maybe as an optional video or just reading materials. Thank you.",4,1,182
2786,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,nice course even few chapters could be more detailled technically speaking. However the assignements are very nice and helps to complete the understanding. Many thanks for such work,4,1,181
2787,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Thank you Andrew Ng for making me comfortable with the deep learning topics on Sequential data...Assessments were interesting ..can be made to enable us better play with the models,4,1,180
2788,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Week 2 was wonderful to learn and understand. I wish to explore more on LSTM and Attention based models. Video lectures were not enough for me. Still I am happy for what I learnt.,4,1,179
2789,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Overall it is a good course. Much need to improve on the feedback of grading of which output is not really helping. Referring to global variables in assignments are really tricky.,4,1,179
2790,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall a very good course , i wish the model construction ( i.e. the rationale in stacking up the layers) is covered in bit more detail, otherwise an excellent course, no doubt.",4,1,178
2791,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The assignments can be made a little difficult. Can Include assignments of Image captioning, that would have been great. Overall a great course. Sir Andrew Ng, superb teaching!!",4,1,177
2792,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,great course as always by andrew. would give it a 5/5 but had some sloppy mistakes regarding the formulas. overal impression : exceptional and highly recommended. thanks andrew!,4,1,177
2793,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Compared to the previous courses, this one was a little hard for me. Because Dr. Andrew tried to squeezed a bunch of information in this course. It's a wonderful course though.",4,1,176
2794,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some of the assignments are very difficult to pass. I think I understand the concepts but the instructions for the assignments could be a lot clearer and provide more guidance.,4,1,176
2795,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is great. The assignment sessions are a little confusing. It would be good to show the complete codes for the test cases so that test errors can be easier to debug. ,4,1,176
2796,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I did not feel like I got a super clear understanding on how to use various library functions in keras, I did gain a really good understanding of the underlying models though! ",4,1,176
2797,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Week1 lessons are a little complex than the previous classes and there are gaps between ground-up python version and keras version of LSTM model. Keras will need to be taught a bit more in detail to follow up. ,4,1,210
2798,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This is by far the hardest course in the specialization. But it was explained well. My only complain is there were errors in the first programming exercise. All in all, I learned a lot in this specialization.",4,1,208
2799,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great content! I really love Andrew's teaching style. (1 star deduction for some programming assignments where I spent time debugging but it turned out that the point deduction was due to the grading system.),4,1,208
2800,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Overall course content is great but I feel like improvements can be made on the lab exercises to give students concrete understanding along with hands-on experience. A great job by the deeplearning.AI team.,4,1,206
2801,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The programming exercises are a little heavy in this course where we need to load and re-load for them to give correct output even if the code had been correct all throughout. Otherwise, the course is great.",4,1,207
2802,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"4 stars and not 5 stars because the course is shorter than the others and it feels like an exemple in classical forecasting is lacking (sales, time series...). ",4,1,160
2803,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It's an excellent course! I will give it 5 stars if it could offer more interesting and meaningful assignments(Not offend, but it a little too easy and the assignments are not very related to the real work). ",4,1,208
2804,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course should contain more explanation about natural language processing like tf-idf,lemmatization,stemming,dialog flow. Although i got a good explanation of working of RNNs,LSTM and machine translation",4,1,206
2805,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course to start off with sequence model. The programming exercises were in depth and deliver a great learning experience. Would love to see more of sequence literature in the course's future versions.,4,1,206
2806,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Again a brilliant course from Andrew NG, but though and dense this time. In order to grasp the meanings videos and lectures need to be revised a few times. Also, get some extra info elsewhere does not hurt.",4,1,206
2807,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent presentation, and interesting assignments. One star dropped because a couple of technical issues with the assignment material (typos in the mathematical formulas / expected results here and there)",4,1,206

2809,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course, but I felt the gap between the very high level lectures and very low level labs was a bit too wide. I had some issues with the autograder and losing progress in the notebook between sessions.",4,1,205
2810,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course. The only frustrating part are the programming assignments as it is very cumbersome to have to go thru the discussion forums to resolve issues. Tough to find helpful insights thru the forums. ,4,1,205
2811,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Andrew Ng is perfect like everytime. I didn't have any issue with programming exercises unlike other comment so probably it fixed. I wish course  to be more detailed especially training word vectors part. ,4,1,205
2812,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very well produced and explained.  In my case, the nature of the Sequence Model makes understanding the concepts and finishing the assignment more challenging than other segments of the specialization.",4,1,201
2813,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is very short when compared to first 3 courses in this series. It would have been better if more explanation and shorter assignments were provided in the initial weeks and increase the pace.,4,1,201
2814,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The previous courses raised the bar and expectations. The assignments for Week 1 and Week 2 were a bit unclear. Lectures for Week 1 and Week 2 can be improved as well. Besides, this is a great course!",4,1,200
2815,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The material itself is very informative and useful. But I have to give ""just"" 4 stars because, the training videos have to be edited better and there were a few mistakes in the programing exercises.",4,1,198
2816,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Please work on getting the notebooks to work properly. Also very bummed that after canceling my subscription, I won't have access to my homeworks. You guys should give us lifelong access - we paid!",4,1,197
2817,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A general overview into the power of sequence models. There is no rigorous mathematics here so most of what students can learn is high-level implementation and intuition about the various models. ,4,1,196

2939,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"more excercise should be there in last course, but overall content was very good",4,1,80
2940,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The Attention model still needs more explanation. I haven't completely grasped attention models,4,1,95
2941,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,More errors than most in the projects. Likely due to the rush of getting this final course out,4,1,94
2942,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good course, informative and easy to follow. Only problem I had is with its auto grader.",4,1,93

2951,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,A great course on NLP including Transformers. One star down for quite a brief introduction to transformers (I understand that time passes but you better update the course),4,1,171
2952,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The videos are of high quality as always, while the programming exercises had some error in it. Compare with the previous few courses this one seems not polished so well.",4,1,170

2955,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Thank you Deep learning team for putting together this course. The course has really helped me understand the various possibilities with the knowledge of deep learning.,4,1,168
2956,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The first week was a bit too tough compared to the second and third. So, I felt it was a bit hurried. It could have been distributed into two separate weeks, perhaps. ",4,1,167
2957,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course was very useful. I would make the programming assignments for the first session a bit clear. Other than that, everything was easy to understand and clear.",4,1,166
2958,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Good, but not as in depth as the other lecture series I found. It is faster paced and skips over much more of the detail at which they go into in the earlier modules. ",4,1,167
2959,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"If the programming exercises weren't plagued by some bugs, I would have given 5 star. It's a very complex subject matter, but Andrew takes you through it by the hand.",4,1,166

2965,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Wonderful, I just felt at times that the exercises were more similar to general programming than sequence modelling. Still, 10/10 course, would totally recommend.",4,1,162
2966,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,this course provide an adequate and what you want to know about recurrent neural network but it does require lots of programming skills to accomplish this course.,4,1,162

3149,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"in comparison to the previous courses from this sequence, this one is even less structured - ptobably this is because even broader knowledge is tried to be shown in only 3 weeks, but i feel like a lot is skipped between videos (which are ok) and the tasks - in many assignment tasks in this course it is not very well explained what is meant to be done - i mean this especially in case of Keras objects. In many cases it is quite unclear how those classes are supposed to be handled in the context of our task. There are some hints but those are mostly links to documentation (btw, some of the links are no longer up to date), but it is often not too well explained which properties those objects have, what one can do etc. so one ends up with trying using those objects in different configuarations, then googling around, looking on the course forum for the right answer but it is very difficult to derive it. There should be more precise instructions regarding handling Keras objects - the examples in the documentation and in blogs are often much simpler than those from assignments so one ends up not knowing what is going on. In summary - there is a big jump and a big gap between the intuitions in videos (which btw are much more fuzzy than those in first cources in the specialization, the intuitions get more and more superfluous as one doesnt go into detail) and what is being done in the assignments. One thing i really liked about hte previous assignments was that when writing the code one could really know very well what is going on. And this is no longer the case in this course...",3,0,1596
3150,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"As we head to the last course in the specialization (and the last two courses are the ones that interested me), we have error after error in the assignments, including problems with the kernel that are not obvious until you've struggled with incoherent stack trace output for a while.",3,0,284

However I think he doesn't provide enough explanations of complicated topics like GRU's and LSTM's. There are lots of confusing aspects of both such technologies, and he could afford to spend even more time in explanation than he does.",3,0,403
3152,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"Unlike the other courses which Andrew Ng provides, this one contains many spelling mistakes in the programming assignment, the programming assignments are less structured and understandable (missing or wrong information in nearly every assignment) and an introduction to keras is missing. I found it great that the keras framework is an important component of this course, but unlike the tensorflow introduction it is missing here. It is frustrating, when you might have the right functions but no information how to input and determine the correct variables for the functions. Anyway I found the outline of the course very good as it gives a good overview of many methods and how they work. To my mind the consistency of the assignments and also the story telling needs to be improved to reach the level of other courses where Andrew is involved. It appeared more chaotic and the complexity of the algorithms is overwhelming, so a better introduction to how they work, might be appealing. In the end, I worked through it and I gained a basic understanding of keras and RNN algorithms. So it was definitely worth it.",3,0,1116

3154,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The subject matter was a good introduction to various RNN model types and concepts.  I have to dock a couple stars, however, as the course leans so heavily on Keras implementations during the assignments that it really should be listed as a firm requirement.  While I feel that I'm more experienced with both RNN models and the use of Keras now, it was a struggle with what felt like a lot of cargo culting for me to get through most of the assignments.  I don't consider the brief lesson on Keras at the end of the second course to be sufficient training, particularly if much time has passed between taking that course and this one.  A brief ""Lesson 0"" on Keras is sorely needed at the beginning of this course.  Otherwise, it should be explicitly and firmly communicated at the start that the programming assignments require a certain familiarity with the Keras framework.  Overall, I do highly recommend this course, but be forewarned about the need to be familiar with Keras before starting.",3,0,996
3155,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The material provides a strong overview of sample problems for which sequence models work well. However, the class doesn't give users the conceptual mastery needed to apply sequence models to new or related problems.

Course 5 on sequence models was much more ""hand wavy"" than Course 4 on convolution models.  At the end of Course 5, I'm still not sure if I learned anything meaningful other than filling in a few blank lines of code to complete the assignment.  There was much less intuition provided about the nature of recurrent nets, and then translating that to code was foggy.  More attention needs to be paid to how and what the framework is actually doing, not just giving hints at filling the blanks.",3,0,635
3157,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:Star:,"The best part of the course are ""intuitions"" presented by Prof. Ng. The worst parts are technical problems with Coursera infrastructure, and insufficient number of mentors available to offer suggestions. For example, in forums there are some doubts about the optional parts of assignments (bad formulas etc.), but these quite valid questions are just not addressed by anybody. I would also suggest adding a separate course on Keras as a part of the specialization, because the Keras introduction offered in a specialization is way too basic. This makes it quite difficult to go through the assignments for the sequential models.

During this course I had to refer to other websites to gain more technical understanding about LSTM and GRU.

5568,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course has excellent content. Unfortunately there seems to be a slight drop in quality compared to the other courses in this series, with respect to the programming assignments. I didn't find them to be very clearly explained or illuminating. ",4,1,248
5569,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures were outstanding (as usual), but the programming assignments (except for the final Trigger Word assignment) were terrible.  I spent almost all my time trying to figure out Keras syntax, without ever having a Keras tutorial or anything.  If you are going to rely on Keras, you should probably add a tutorial or some references.  A lot of wasted time.  But other than that, this course was amazing.",4,1,409
5570,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good course. I liked the speech recognition part more. I found the assignments involving Keras code difficult to do in both RNN and CNN courses. Without the help of discussion forum i wouldn't have completed the Keras assignments. Thank you all the fellow students and mentors for your contributions to the discussion forum. Thank you so much Andrew and team for putting this awesome specialization :),4,1,406
5571,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As the other courses in this series, this is definitely another great course, and explains to details the various sequence models. I gave it 4 stars because I believe it might need some improvements. Compared to the previous courses it felt a little rushed, and had too much new information and long programming exercises for a single week. Maybe it would have been better if it was 4 weeks instead of 3.",4,1,404
5572,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Always a great course but I would expect to have more lessons on how to use Keras and Tensor Flow API in a better way for who needs to use them in real NLP applications. I still have some doubts on how to use them correctly (for example the use of time distributed layer in the last exercise 'trigger word detection' that we didn't use in the architecture for the exercise about attention mechanism),4,1,399
5573,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot. The descriptions of GRUs and LSTMs were a little scant, however, and I found myself rewatching the videos trying to get my head around them. The course could be improved by going into a little more detail about the different gates and what it means to train them, or what sorts of information or patterns might be relevant for the training of a gate.",4,1,398
5574,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Although I loved the course and learnt a lot, I don't feel as confident trying to implement some sort of sequence modelling in practice compared to the other courses. And yet I still got full marks for this section. I think the course could have been spread out to 4 weeks with a few extra examples (maybe some stock market prediction examples). Regardless, thank you so much for the teachings!",4,1,394
5575,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I really enjoyed learning this course and gained a lot of knowledge from it. The only challenge that I found was some of the steps of the assignments were not clear. I could resolve them by checking the forum. I would also like to know more about document summary and document similarity, but there was not much content for it. Overall, thanks a lot for putting this valuable content together. ",4,1,394
5576,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great material and amazing Andrew Ng (5 stars) but very pure editoral review (videos with a lot of repeats of canceled phrases, pauses, quiz understanding, grader problems, very poorness of mentors support because they can do nothing to help, neither contact deeplearning.ai, in summary it's looks like alpha version of course not release and diserve 3 or even 2 stars), so in total 4 stars.",4,1,391
5577,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course is almost as good as the prior four, but some of the lectures lack detail, there are mistakes in some quizzes, and the programming assignments at times are crammed too full of information. You can end up passing through this class without really understanding what's going on, whereas the CNN class does a much better job of forcing you to understand things before you pass. ",4,1,387
5578,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Excellent lecture content.,4,1,26
5579,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures were great, making an advanced subject accessible. The course materials were mostly good -- the exception being the optional (non-graded) assignment in Week 1, which was not well-structured, and failed to reinforce the concepts it was intended to. There were challenges with connectivity to the Jupyter notebook server, which caused much frustration and wasted time.",4,1,379
5580,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Another great course by Prof. Ng. The reason for 4 stars is that I found the assignments to gloss over a lot of new Keras ideas (for Keras beginners) at the expense of spending more time on how the ideas were being implemented. I think the course should be spread out over more weeks, say 5, and spend the extra time going into more depth around the Keras model architectures.",4,1,376
5581,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,In the lecture videos there have been quite a few repetitions and in the programming exercises the necessary Keras background has not been delivered. For this I have to subtract one star.,4,1,187
5582,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course could have covered topics like time-series modeling for prediction (sales, demand, a machine failure in a factory, etc) that is much more applicable than some of the assignments proposed here (half of them seemed to be just for fun). Also, I am a little dissapointed that the course didn't cover chatbots, which is one of the most widely used applications for RNNs.",4,1,376
5583,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course was nice but more mathematics could be taught in the lectures, especially backpropagation in recurrent network. Also I feel there could be one more week in this course where recent models like Transformers and BERT can be taught. Overall a nice course to get familiar with Word Embeddings, LSTM, GRU, and some other topics like Translation and Speech Recognition.",4,1,374
5584,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The discussion felt really complicated at points. Also I was disappointed not to be able to complete the optional assignment for LSTM back propagation. Since it is ungraded, it would have been nice to at least see the correct implementation to learn from. Also there were several errors in the expected values or instructions in the assignments, that were really confusing.",4,1,373
5585,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The instructor Andrew Sir is excellent in conveying topics, but I just found the last part a bit dry compared to the previous 4. ",4,1,129
5586,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Ths course really shows cutting edge technology such as using deep networks consisting of LSTMs, GRUs etc.. I especially liked the audio trigger word recognition.",4,1,162
5587,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It has been quite a good course to explain the tedious concepts of RNN.,4,1,71
5588,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Concur with other reviewers: this class was good, covering a lot of interesting material and with well-structured quizzes & assignments. But the lectures seemed to skip past the sorts of in-depth explanations I wanted, instead just getting to the end point of ""this is what this looks like"". So good, but not quite as good as previous courses in the specialization.",4,1,365
5589,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course is great to get intuitive understanding of Word Embeddings, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs and Attention Models.",4,1,111
5590,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Really cool applications to work on, but the videos got a little too much into specific applications that may not be relevant most of the time.  It was all interesting, but it made this course a lot longer each week.  I could have done without a lot of the specifics of certain applications, just because it will be hard to apply/remember the concepts anyways.",4,1,360
5591,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I like the course for the very deep understanding of sequence models. But I really didn't like some practical tasks (especially closer to the end of course) as they are quite difficult to debug. It takes much time and doesn't get the feeling you understand how to handle with problems. Would love to have some insights about improving models debugging skill.,4,1,358
5592,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"All courses in this specialization are awesome. However, this last course feels a little rushed in comparison with the other 4 courses. While the first 3 courses raise your knowledge of ANN in preparation to the 4th one, it is a little more difficult to understand this 5th course. Likewise, completing the assignments is possible, but more frustrating.",4,1,353

If you further refuse to do so (literally thousands of complaints about the autograder in the forums -> nothing happens) you will not. Check out Scala courses approach with grading -> works like a charm. Cheers, JJ",4,1,352
5619,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The content is generally great and well worth it. I wish they would fix 
some of the errors, especially in ungraded exercises. You end up wasting
 a lot of time because of them. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect is 
navigating to the Jupyter notebooks. I wish the links to the notebooks 
were on the same pages as the Submission and Discussion links.",4,1,352
5620,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I learned a lot. I would give 5 starts but the jupyter notebooks were very very buggy.  I spent half of my time on the homework going through the forums to find workarounds.  It took away from learning the material efficiently.  ,4,1,229
5621,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is very interesting and it gives an insight into recurrent neural networks (RNN). The practical exercises are interesting but I found them in a bit raw state compared to the previous courses of the Deep Learning Specialization. Nevertheless I would still highly recommend to follow this course. Thanks a lot to organizers. ,4,1,334
5622,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Everything seems logical, except the programming assignments. Although I went through week 1 programming assignments only, I often had to face some problems with insufficient information. Lecture videos are easy to understand, but not all the details are explained. (This is the point where I need to find some information by hand.)",4,1,332
5623,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As a non-computer science background student, the course was overwhelming, I got lost in the equations most of the time. Maybe a lower level course could be considered before starting this one. Nevertheless, this was an informative course about sequence models. Lots of quizzes and programming assignments reinforced my learning.",4,1,329
5624,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Videos are great; but as usual TP are too guided (hence boring) and do not use today frameworks (Pytorch, tensorflow 2). TPs should either be completely coded by candidates (only introduction + resfresh on concepts + objectives) with evaluation on final accuracy/f1 score <or> they should be no TPs at all and more MCQ tests ",4,1,325
5625,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Content her is great - the first week covers the basic RNN models in a very clear way and the assignments are interactive and interesting, building on the explanations in lectures. One downsides is that the production quality is poor and would benefit from some re-recording to remove bloopers and make it smoother to watch.",4,1,324
5626,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I wish it was a bit more interesting. It also kinda feels like Andrew has a bit of a problem himself in understanding the paradigms stated in this course, and that makes me feel somewhat confused as well. Would recommend for the math, the notations are weird and confusing sometimes but it is understandable for most parts.",4,1,323
5627,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This is a very interesting course with good explanations, which give a brief but sufficient introduction to sequential models like GRU and LSTM. One star is dropped because the CNN course (#4) is still better than this one in terms of explanations, while course #2 is better in terms of relevant material and pace (to me). ",4,1,323
5628,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Although I really really really love this series and although I always gave 5 stars, I think the quality of this last module is a lot less better than the previous ones. I think convolution was way more difficult but the explanation was awesome. Unfortunately, i think explanations in this module are a little sloppy. ",4,1,318
5629,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As usual, Andrew Ng's stellar talent as an educator shines through. Unfortunately, some of the video editing is a little scrappy, and the assignments could use some more polish. Especially in areas where they catch quirks in the grader. Luckily the forum support is excellent. This course is definitely worth doing. ",4,1,316
5630,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall nice course, learned a lot about NLP and Speech to text. Course is more oriented towards NLP applications, I was also hoping to learn more about time series analysis. Feel like the course could have been longer 4-5 weeks since RNN, LSTM and GRU is pretty long topic and 3 weeks seems to be too short for it. ",4,1,316
5631,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Recomiendo ampliamente este curso, te proporciona un claro entendimiento de los modelos secuenciales y recurrentes. Es excelente, aunque a diferencia de otros cursos de esta especialización no explicaron en detalle algunos aspectos de las RNN, me hubiese gustado que profundizaran un poco más en backpropagation.",4,1,312
5632,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The RNN, LSTM< and GRU were very good. But the Week 3seemed a bit abstract. More could have been covered in Audio, Attention.",4,1,125
5633,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This course provided a nice high level overview of RNN models and associated Keras implementations. The tricks and tips given were a useful addition to my ML arsenal. The only thing that I feel discredits this course is that the programming assignments are easy to gloss over and pass without much engagement. ,4,1,310
5634,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great introduction to RNNs and how to implement them in keras.  I suspect it is a relatively new course as there are still typos and a few errors in the assignments (otherwise I would have given 5 stars) but the forums help you to find your way around them and hopefully in future versions they will be fixed.,4,1,309
5635,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent lectures, some part was difficult and it took time for me to imagine the content of each parameter (e.g. when we talk about X, or a, or Waa what is the size of them and what do they represent). But in the exercises, it became more understandable. Exercises need previous knowledge of Keras and OOP.",4,1,308
5636,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It is a fabulous course content-wise. However, I personally find the programming exercises overly easy (the instructors already build the framework for you and the only thing you need to do is to fill in the blanks),  s.t. I'm still not able to build an RNN from scratch after completing all those exercises.",4,1,308
5637,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This course is good. It introduces the concepts regarding recurrent models. I specially like the attention model videos. In general, the exercises are well written. However, I'm not very familiar with Keras and working on the Keras code really takes my time even I'm quite experienced with Tensorflow.",4,1,301
5638,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Professor Ng did a good job explaining sequence model and I finally understand the basic theories. However, there is room to improve especially on the Keras library part. I hope you can add some simple tutorial for that.

5719,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is really good if you want to get a good understanding on the basics of deep learning. It would have been great if the course had more hand's on assignments than fill in the blanks kind of assignments in ipython notebook. ,4,1,233
5720,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I learnt a lot from this course and the whole specialization. I am grateful to the mentors and instructors. If coursera gives me opportunity I can also be mentor for the specialization to help the newcomers through the assignments. ,4,1,232
5721,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"During the first week, I think that a deeper explanation of the matrices' dimensions throughout the NNs should be given. Indeed, this would be helpful to understand some concepts.",4,1,179
5722,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course was good except first week. I did not learn as much as I would like from the programming exercises of week 1. It could be nice to have 4 weeks instead of 3 for this course. Taking more time to cover the week 1 material.,4,1,230
5723,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Everything is perfect, the teaching is excellent, the only problem is the jupyter notebook, its sometimes difficult to debug issues and takes a lot of time and is kind of vague as well in terms of application of the lectures.",4,1,225
5724,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Thanks to Andrew Ng and his amazing team, this course challenged my fundamental knowledge of Tensorflow and ML algorithms in the most useful way. However, I expected more applying libraries to design the NLP recent products. ",4,1,225
5725,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"some topics not explained in detail. Not enough examples to understand some models completely. As an example, I didn't fully understand what are the parameters for the models, their shapes, and how they are used in the model",4,1,224
5726,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course! But I find the transformer assignment bit difficult. I think if the implementation would be covered in a 10-15 minutes video it would be a lot more easier to understand. Thank you for the great specialisation!,4,1,223
5727,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall it was pretty informational on introducing NLP to me. However, Keras was a little bit frustrating to learn at the beginning. I found out the forum was a very good resource to learn Keras syntax whenever I was stuck.",4,1,223
5728,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course! I do feel like I'm just scratching the surface of the types of applications that I can make. I think the coding segments still hold our hands a little too much, but you can't beat the clarity of the lectures. ",4,1,223
5729,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course lecture is grade but I hope the assignment is better in guiding structure, something the explanation is hard to follow, and the assignment should include the transfer learning instead of using the trained model.",4,1,222
5730,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This was hard to keep up with, maybe too hard. The assignments' difficulty also was on a different level then the lectures maybe there more time should be put into the lecture videos as it was the case for DNN and RNN.",4,1,218
5731,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The videos and programming exercises were very interesting and insightful. My only complain is some of notebooks for exercises include errors and it was just a time-wasting  task to find the ""trick"" to pass the grader.",4,1,218
5732,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The content is well captured and Andrew really helps build the required intuitions. But, the assignments are too guided. There is no room to struggle for solutions which often proves to be the main source of learning.",4,1,217
5733,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I think the transformer programming exercise of this fifth course is not as good as the others. The methods we must implement are not clearly explained and the research on these really took me a huge amount of time.,4,1,215
5734,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The exercises are too short and too basic for this course specifically. The task is a great learning experience but there is not much one would struggle with in terms of difficulty as there is too much spoon feeding.,4,1,216
5735,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great video lectures, but practical assignments are a pain due to awful auto-grading system and programming expirience in Jupyter in general. Most of the time you'll be searching for an error that isn't really there.",4,1,216
5736,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent course, excellent lecturer. Unfortunately some of the test data (week3/lab/trigger word detection/XY_dev/* CANNOT BE DOWNLOADED ... The programming lab sections are nice - sometime a bit too helped ... ;) ",4,1,215
5737,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"It is better to talk more about bi-directional RNN and give assightment about it before week three and week four. Moreover, it is also better to give two more weeks to talk more about the material in week 3 and 4.",4,1,213
5738,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Programming exercises did show you quite a bit, but got complex enough that most of my time was spent reading and understanding the preamble than doing any programming. That being said it delivered on the promise.",4,1,213
5739,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Course content is really good! However, I found it quite difficult to truly understand deep learning algorithms. However, it provides good glimpse of of sequence models and intuitions behind various useful models.",4,1,213
5740,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great course and material, Andrew NG really know who to explain difficult subjects in an intuitive way. However, the course seems that it still needs some work (there are some bugs in the lectures and assignments)",4,1,213
5741,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lectures are suitable. Andrew, as always, is very clear and goes into necessary detail on each topic.",4,1,105
5742,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The NLP Section of this course is quite difficult to understand(The Notations are quite confusing as well as prior knowledge is required to understand) but other than that RNN, GRU, LTSM are explained clearly.",4,1,209
5743,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Much more challenging than the other courses in the DL specialisation. It forced me to delve a little deeper into the topic in order to overcome obstacles in the assignments. Content-wise, it's a great introduction to DL for NLP. Professor Ng's explanations are perfect.",4,1,270
5744,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course itself is cutting-edge, so a 5-star for this.",4,1,56
5745,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"In general, about all the specialization, I think that some of the programming assigments could be more didactive to understand the concepts of the courses and not to find what the code is doing in that specific task. For all the others aspects of the course I think it's perfect for a litlle bit more than an introduction.",4,1,323
5746,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It's a good intro to RNNs (LSTMS and GRU).  Very interesting use cases for RNNs. I feel that there could have been more room to try more programming exercises for different use cases & RNN architectures. Be aware that Keras is very sensitive to changes and you will find yourself reloading the jupyter kernels repeateadly when you get stuck. This is not a problem of the course itself but it is something that could end up wasting a lot of your time chasing problems when your code actually should work.  ,4,1,505
5747,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The lecture videos are great. Andrew is a great teacher in teaching concepts at the most intuitive level. By the time I finished the course, I had sufficient knowledge to be able to read and understand the paper. ",4,1,213
5748,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Another great course by Andrew Ng! This course is part of the CS230 class currently being taught at Stanford University. Only reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that at this stage (April 2018), there are few knowledgeable mentors and virtually no Instructors present in the Forum. Course provides little introduction to the syntax of Keras, which makes for some problems implementing models. Therefore one might spend a lot of time spinning one's wheels until finding a way forward.",4,1,483
5749,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"This last course is the most difficult challenge in the entire specialization, I personally have to watch back the video lectures many times. But I appreciate Andrew's efforts in transmitting knowledge in the most possibly understandable way.
In the assignment section, I found it necessary to have advanced experience in Python to be able to comprehend. Even if you have completed all the exercises, I believe most of you would only understand about 30-40% what you were doing.",4,1,479
5750,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"As with all the 5 courses in the Deep Learning Specialization, the video lectures were amazing, thoughtfully designed (and separated) and gave an understandable overview of the content. As for the programming assignements, some lack a clear description of what is to do - that mostly concerns single steps withing a sub-task though. Tensorflow and Keras need a considerable amount of self-study next to the lectures to truly understand what you are doing there.",4,1,461
5751,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"NLP is definitely my favorite application of DL. This course was fun, although W4's assignment was quite confusing. Maybe it'd be nice to clarify that though the labs are ungraded, they'll help the learner deepen understanding of concepts and to explicitely recommend that they're completed before the assignment, so overall learning process becomes smoother. ",4,1,360
5752,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Theoretical knowledge gained during this course is good, for beginners in this area they learn what can be done and how. Only minus is practical assignements which are too straightforward, it's helpfull to have guide what to do, but maybe some assignement which doesn't have too much of a guide could be good (not necessarily the one which is graded but something which makes you to think a little bit more rather than follow the tips and writing Python code).",4,1,460
5753,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I enjoyed this course very much. The videos were very informative covering a lot of ground in RNNs. I also enjoyed the assignments which covered both implementation of RNNs from scratch to get a good feel for it, and practical implementations. I was a bit disappointed about NLP section as it brushed over word embedding and left me without much understanding on how they are estimated. I would also like to have seen time-series covered in this course.",4,1,453
5754,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I loved all of the courses in the specialization. However, last two (sequence models and convolutional NNs) had in my opinion poor exercises, not well described, or emphasizing the parts which are not that important, omitting at the same time more important topics. For example the last exercise with spectogram was mainly focused on preparing the data rather than explaining/practicing algorithms. All in all, I gave 4/5 which is still very good grade. ",4,1,454
5755,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I dont understand why notebooks are become unavailable when I am working on it. It says method not allowed and then please login through www.coursera.org. Then I had to run all the cells again. I think this is because of the lack of resources like # of servers available. Other than that, like the content of the programming assignments. Especially the trigger word detection algorithm worked perfect with my own voice, that was satisfying of course.",4,1,450
5755,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It's a great course. The information and knowledge that you get about Sequence Models is fantastic as a primer. Andrew is an amazing teacher throughout the entire specialization altough I found the content of the videos in the Sequence Models slightly more rushed than the previous 4 courses...,4,1,294
5756,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,This course is a great introduction to sequence models and a great way of finishing the specialization. All main areas were covered. It is a good entry point for those who want to keep improving their sequence-models skills. ,4,1,225
5757,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I got an overview of how people use this technology but the whole network architecture and especially dimensioning remains to be somewhat of a black art. ,4,1,154
5758,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Awesome course.  It feels like this one was more rushed than the others in the Specialization.  I am a bit concerned whether the ""Specialization"" has become a ""Survey"" of the course, and leans heavily on the assignments for teaching..but then, could do more for why some architectures are the way they are.  The assignments improved from being a spoon-feeding exercise. That's good.  But, on the other side, Keras documentation was confusing.",4,1,442
5759,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The 5th course materials were not as solid as the previous 4 courses. Mainly due to heavily use of Keras API and lack of Numpy implementation. There is nothing to complain about indeed as for the same amount of content the 5th courses had covered, implementing on Numpy will take way longer. Maybe adding more explanation on how the Keras API work will help a tons. Overall it is a very good course that I would recommend anyone to enroll.",4,1,439
5760,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Excellent series of courses! Loved the lectures and thoroughly enjoyed the exercises! A big thanks to Andrew Ng and all the instructors and mentors. The forums provided useful hints on the couple of occasions I was stuck. While I would have initially suggested providing more info on Keras APIs, in hindsite the additional time spent in searching Keras documentation was useful arriving at better understanding of the infrastructure.",4,1,433
5761,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The Literature for RNN's was not motivating enough compared to Convolutional Networks and the previous courses. However, Andrew did concentrate on the important aspects which would help us in building RNN ourselves. I did feel the assignments were not as elaborative and extensive as the CNN's but I understand the idea behind it (being just to make users aware of the skeleton of the model instead of doing everything from scratch). ",4,1,434
5762,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The theory was absolutely interesting and an eye-opener. The programming exercises were hard to make because of the keras/tensorflow knowledge and I actually ended up just fill-in in things, as were given in the examples, without really knowing what I was doing. Time for a Tensorflow course.",4,1,292

5764,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Though the lessons are interesting and mathematically demanding, I felt that it was a good time spent learning these concepts. Overall I feel that the 3 weeks could be split into 4 weeks and learning could have been much smoother by adding some more lessons to address the contents of Week 2. ",4,1,293
5765,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,I Love it! every single part of the course!,4,1,43
5766,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Nice content, but the assignments are too easy and only demonstrate the pipeline instead of providing hand-on experience in picking the network and training with GPU. Also, there are some grader problems which has wasted my time to make my code pass the grader even if the answer is correct.",4,1,291
5767,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The homework grading methods need improvement. I got the right model and get the right results, but still have to spend tons of time to make the submission pass the grading system. It is a waste of time for future learning.  You may want to train a DL model to solve this grading problem :). ",4,1,292
5768,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great explanation of theory (RNNs etc.) and easy to follow course structure. The programming exercises are disappointing though: They mostly consist of mindlessly copying Keras functions without an understandable (!) explanation.

However some theoretical blank-spaces are still left. For instance - nothing is said about how recursive gates are being updated during BPTT backward pass. For someone who has the some experience and read some other sources that is not a big deal, but for a complete first-timer who pays attention and uses his brain - this is a pure flaw.",4,1,433
5771,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very interesting application of deep learning. Gives a good overview. Assignments are fun, yet it's too easy to complete the assignments without understanding the big picture. I found the ""attitude"" assignment in week 3 a bit difficult to grasp however. Particularly liked the dinosaur names, emojify, the humour and positivity in the course: mentioning gender/racial bias, encouraging people to do good with their skills. Namaste!",4,1,431
5772,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very good overall. Andrew Ng explains the material clearly and accessibly.,4,1,74
5773,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I thought the course and the specialization was great for people who want to get into the details of deep learning. Although I enjoyed learning about all the details, I wish there was a separate course specifically for Keras and TensorFlow. In practice, we will rarely have to implement the models from scratch, and having a better understanding of Keras and TensorFlow would be more helpful in terms of career prospects. ",4,1,422

However, the hws of the course is too much focused on language translation. They could put another examples, say business data, to represent other applications of RNN/LSTMs.",4,1,289
5778,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The course should provide more instruction on the Keras and Tensorflow, since the notebook is largely dependent on the knowledge of these frameworks. Moreover, the logic of programming is not so well-organized: I personally prefer to have my own logic instead of modules got implemented :)",4,1,289
5779,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Really interesting course with overview about sequence models and what can you do with them. Lectures from prof. NG are amazing as usual. The only thing I was missing was maybe more tutorials on Keras LSTM usage. The exercises on LSTM were quite confusing, especially using shared layers.  ",4,1,290

Additionally Tensorflow and Keras syntax is not very elegant or coherent as they are such high-level languages.

5782,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Finally, the last course was completed. For me, this course is very difficult, because the content of the course is somewhat obscure and difficult to understand.

On the other hand there are some confusions or errors in the backpropagation part of the programming assignment about LSTM.,4,1,239
5914,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I am rating this course 4 because It doesn't give any guidance about future career paths and next things to learn. The explanations are very good. I understood complex things like GRU, LSTM, Bidirectional RNN, attention model very well.",4,1,236
5915,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"While a great introduction on RNNs, I felt there could be another week of lectures given the complexity of the algorithms being explained. Likewise, the programming exercises felt unpolished in some parts, like in the expected outputs.",4,1,235
5916,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good. To make it perfect, would have liked it for the Assignments to have less bugs (cf. LSTM backprop), and a longer course with extra weeks to present LSTM in the context of prediction (finance, weather, pattern recognition,...)",4,1,235
5917,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Great course! only negative is that problems would really hold your hand.  I don't think there is any way I would pass a whiteboard test on any of this (then again a course to get me to that level would have to be double this length).,4,1,234
5918,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very useful materials, but a little hard to digest. It will be more helpful if course lectures and slides can dive a little deeper into each model and provide more granular technical details.",4,1,191
5919,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Exercises are sometimes vague and can be done without full understanding of the material. No officially given notes. No reading material that explains the concepts more clearly and in detail.,4,1,191
5920,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,One of the best course i ever taken. glad to be part of such wonderful course teach by prof.andrew ng. learn a lot about sequence model and NLP. Highly Highly recommended for beginner in NLP ,4,1,191
5921,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Great Course, very insightful excercises, really enjoyed it - unfortunately some issues with the programming excercises.",4,1,120
5922,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"the course content was really impressive, but some topics need to be explained in detail. Also working of LSTM should be further described in detail. Programming assignments are really fun.",4,1,189
5923,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"great course, lots of implementation details that are important were glossed over, while other areas had too much hw hand-holding + strict requirements on what the code needed to look like.",4,1,189
5924,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very glad I took this course!  A little rough around the edges as far as video / assignment quality, but seeing that this is the very first run of this course, I know it will only improve.",4,1,188
5925,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The material was great. Some of the programming assignments ramped up in difficulty or lack of perfect execution. However, I still gained extremely valuable information from this course. ",4,1,187
5926,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The lecture for Sequence model was good motivation to get interesting about text and audio processing. All of lectures were very fundamental and intuitive. Thank you very much. Prof. Ng.,4,1,186
5927,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good and fun course in the sequence. However, it would be very nice if there were some examples of using RNN for things such as self driving etc, outside the realm of speech and NLP",4,1,186
5928,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course videos are very good. However the optional parts of assignments have lots of issues and errors. Please update the assignment to reduce the time wasted unnecessarily debugging.,4,1,186
5929,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Very interesting exercice and assignments from which a lot is to learn. Content quite complicated which will require from me to come back for review and deepen some points. Thank you !,4,1,184
5930,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,It was necessary to study extensively the Keras framework to fulfill the code tasks. I suggest an extra module with small simple RNN modeling exercises to better adapt the framework.,4,1,182
5931,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall, I really like this module. One possible improvement might be providing more information for backpropagation. Maybe as an optional video or just reading materials. Thank you.",4,1,182
5932,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,nice course even few chapters could be more detailled technically speaking. However the assignements are very nice and helps to complete the understanding. Many thanks for such work,4,1,181
5933,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Thank you Andrew Ng for making me comfortable with the deep learning topics on Sequential data...Assessments were interesting ..can be made to enable us better play with the models,4,1,180
5934,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Week 2 was wonderful to learn and understand. I wish to explore more on LSTM and Attention based models. Video lectures were not enough for me. Still I am happy for what I learnt.,4,1,179
5935,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Overall it is a good course. Much need to improve on the feedback of grading of which output is not really helping. Referring to global variables in assignments are really tricky.,4,1,179
5936,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Overall a very good course , i wish the model construction ( i.e. the rationale in stacking up the layers) is covered in bit more detail, otherwise an excellent course, no doubt.",4,1,178
5937,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The assignments can be made a little difficult. Can Include assignments of Image captioning, that would have been great. Overall a great course. Sir Andrew Ng, superb teaching!!",4,1,177

5939,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Compared to the previous courses, this one was a little hard for me. Because Dr. Andrew tried to squeezed a bunch of information in this course. It's a wonderful course though.",4,1,176
5940,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,Some of the assignments are very difficult to pass. I think I understand the concepts but the instructions for the assignments could be a lot clearer and provide more guidance.,4,1,176
5941,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The course is great. The assignment sessions are a little confusing. It would be good to show the complete codes for the test cases so that test errors can be easier to debug. ,4,1,176
5942,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"I did not feel like I got a super clear understanding on how to use various library functions in keras, I did gain a really good understanding of the underlying models though! ",4,1,176

5969,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is the course 5 week 4 coding assignment. See my comments in response to post by @marcus-waldman for detail,4,1,145
5970,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,too much content and not much chance to exercise. I will suggest for more frequently and smaller programming assignments through out the course!,4,1,144

5980,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"Very good course, though the assignments towards the end were a little too centered around Keras, which I personally don't care for very much",4,1,141
5981,Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Filled Star:Star:,"The instruction of using Keras in the programming assignment is unclear. There are many bugs as well, hence we have versions 1, 2 and 3 etc.",4,1,140

In many cases it is quite unclear how those classes are supposed to be handled in the context of our task. There are some hints but those are mostly links to documentation (btw, some of the links are no longer up to date), but it is often not too well explained which properties those objects have, what one can do etc. so one ends up with trying using those objects in different configuarations, then googling around, looking on the course forum for the right answer but it is very difficult to derive it. There should be more precise instructions regarding handling Keras objects - the examples in the documentation and in blogs are often much simpler than those from assignments so one ends up not knowing what is going on. In summary - there is a big jump and a big gap between the intuitions in videos (which btw are much more fuzzy than those in first cources in the specialization, the intuitions get more and more superfluous as one doesnt go into detail) and what is being done in the assignments. One thing i really liked about hte previous assignments was that when writing the code one could really know very well what is going on. And this is no longer the case in this course...",3,0,1596

I found it great that the keras framework is an important component of this course, but unlike the tensorflow introduction it is missing here. It is frustrating, when you might have the right functions but no information how to input and determine the correct variables for the functions. Anyway I found the outline of the course very good as it gives a good overview of many methods and how they work. To my mind the consistency of the assignments and also the story telling needs to be improved to reach the level of other courses where Andrew is involved. It appeared more chaotic and the complexity of the algorithms is overwhelming, so a better introduction to how they work, might be appealing. In the end, I worked through it and I gained a basic understanding of keras and RNN algorithms. So it was definitely worth it.",3,0,1116

I have to dock a couple stars, however, as the course leans so heavily on Keras implementations during the assignments that it really should be listed as a firm requirement.  While I feel that I'm more experienced with both RNN models and the use of Keras now, it was a struggle with what felt like a lot of cargo culting for me to get through most of the assignments.  I don't consider the brief lesson on Keras at the end of the second course to be sufficient training, particularly if much time has passed between taking that course and this one.  A brief ""Lesson 0"" on Keras is sorely needed at the beginning of this course.  Otherwise, it should be explicitly and firmly communicated at the start that the programming assignments require a certain familiarity with the Keras framework.  Overall, I do highly recommend this course, but be forewarned about the need to be familiar with Keras before starting.",3,0,996

However, the class doesn't give users the conceptual mastery needed to apply sequence models to new or related problems.

At the end of Course 5, I'm still not sure if I learned anything meaningful other than filling in a few blank lines of code to complete the assignment.  There was much less intuition provided about the nature of recurrent nets, and then translating that to code was foggy.  More attention needs to be paid to how and what the framework is actually doing, not just giving hints at filling the blanks.",3,0,635

The worst parts are technical problems with Coursera infrastructure, and insufficient number of mentors available to offer suggestions. For example, in forums there are some doubts about the optional parts of assignments (bad formulas etc.), but these quite valid questions are just not addressed by anybody. I would also suggest adding a separate course on Keras as a part of the specialization, because the Keras introduction offered in a specialization is way too basic. This makes it quite difficult to go through the assignments for the sequential models.

During this course I had to refer to other websites to gain more technical understanding about LSTM and GRU.

As a whole i think 1 full week of material is missing from this course which would concentrate on the basic RNN building for GRUs and LSTMs and then move on to applications. I usually do not review these courses and they are pretty standard but this course left me wanting and i will consult youtube and free repos to learn about it better. I did not gain confidence on my understanding.  Barely scraped through the assignments after group study and consulting people who know this stuff  (which defeats the purpose of this course i believe.
